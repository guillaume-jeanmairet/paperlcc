	abstract = {Periodic DFT calculations using plane waves basis sets with the GGA formalism were performed in order to study the behavior of the uranyl ion at the water-Ni(1 1 1) interface. First, the adsorption of water molecules interacting with an optimized surface model has been studied. At low coverage, isolated water molecules adsorb preferentially on top of the surface nickel atoms, the plane defined by the H2O molecule being almost parallel to the surface. When the water coverage increases from 1/9 ML to 2/3 ML (ML = monolayer coverage), hydrogen bonds are created leading to the formation of water hexamers, as suggested experimentally on Ni(1 1 1) and other metallic surfaces [A. Michaelides, A. Alavi, D.A. King, Physical Review B 69 (2004) 113404. M. Nakamura, M. Ito, Chemical Physics Letters 325 (2000) 293-298]. Higher water coverage induces the formation of an additional water layer physisorbed over the cyclic hexamers. In a second step, the behavior of with respect to the hydrated Ni(1 1 1) face has been investigated. Evidence that two adsorption modes can take place was put forward: a first one with an outer sphere adsorption mechanism, where two water molecules of the uranyl ion first hydration shell are shared with four water hexamers, and a second one through a strong Ni-O-yle bond formation. Even though the second surface complex is energetically the most stable, the necessary activation energy to reach it makes it improbable.},

Here, we investigate an approach for the sampling of unbiased reduced density matrices within the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo dynamic, which requires only small computational overheads. This is achieved via an independent replica population of walkers in the dynamic, sampled alongside the original population. The resulting reduced density matrices are free from systematic error (beyond those present via constraints on the dynamic itself) and can be used to compute a variety of expectation values and properties, with rapid convergence to an exact limit. A quasi-variational energy estimate derived from these density matrices is proposed as an accurate alternative to the projected estimator for multiconfigurational wavefunctions, while its variational property could potentially lend itself to accurate extrapolation approaches in larger systems.},

	abstract = {The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics of their constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field of the nuclei. The solution of the underlying many-electron Schrödinger equation is a ‘non-polynomial hard’ problem, owing to the complex interplay of kinetic energy, electron–electron repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. The dominant computational method for describing such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical methods—based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate—have not been fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the ‘gold standard’ coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple particle–hole excitation operators. We show the errors in cohesive energies predicted by this method to be small, indicating the potential of this computationally polynomial scaling technique to tackle current solid-state problems.

	abstract = {A computational scheme is proposed for ab initio calculations of electronic spectra of molecular systems. The scheme is firmly based on the different effects that determine the excitation energies and properties of the excited states. It aims to be accurate to better than 0.5 eV for excitation energies and should provide structural and physical data for the excited states. Applications are possible to rather large molecules (up to 20 atoms) with high-quality basis sets. Extensions of the approach will be possible when direct methods have been implemented. The scheme is based on the CASSCF method, which gives a proper description of the major features in the electronic structure of the excited state, independent of its complexity, and accounts for all near-degeneracy effects and includes full orbital relaxation. Remaining dynamic electron correlation effects are added using second-order perturbation theory with the CASSCF wavefunction as the reference state. The electronic spectrum of the benzene molecule is used as an illustration. Using a (C, 4s3p2d/H, 3s2p) atomic natural orbital basis set, the following excitation energies are obtained (experimental values in parentheses); 1B2u, 4.70 (4.90); 1B1u, 6.10 (6.20); 1E1u, 7.06 (6.94); 1E2g, 7.77 (7.80) eV. The computed oscillator strength for the 1E1u state is 1.05 as compared to the experimental 1.25. Results of similar accuracy are obtained for the triplet states.},

	abstract = {Meta-benzoquinodimethane (MBQDM) or m-xylylene provides a model for larger organic diradicals, the triplet–singlet gap being the key property. In the present work this energy difference has been the object of a systematic study by means of several density functional theory-based methods including B3LYP, M06, M06-2X, HSE and LC-ωPBE potentials and a variety of wave function-based methods such as complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF), Multireference second-order Møller–Plesset (MRMP), difference dedicated configuration interaction (DDCI), and Multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). In each case various basis sets of increasing quality have been explored, and the effect of the molecular geometry is also analyzed. The use of the triplet and broken symmetry (BS) solutions for the corresponding optimized geometries obtained from B3LYP and especially M06-2X functionals provide the value of the adiabatic triplet–singlet gap closer to experiment when compared to the reported value of Wenthold, Kim, and Lineberger, (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 1354) and also for the electron affinity. The agreement further improves using the full π-valence CASSCF(8,8) optimized geometry as an attempt to correct for the spin contamination effects on the geometry of the BS state. The CASSCF, MRMP, and MRCI, even with the full π valence CAS(8,8) as reference and relatively large basis set, systematically overestimate the experimental value indicating either that an accurate description must go beyond this level of theory, including σ electrons and higher order polarization functions, or perhaps that the measured value is affected by the experimental conditions.},

Here, we use this technique to elucidate an often troublesome series of first-row diatomics consisting of Be2, C2, CN, CO, N2, NO, O2, and F2. Using i-FCIQMC, the dissociation energies of these molecules are obtained almost entirely to within chemical accuracy of experimental results. Furthermore, the i-FCIQMC calculations are performed in a relatively black-box manner, without any a priori knowledge or specification of the wave function. The size consistency of i-FCIQMC is also demonstrated with regards to these diatomics at their more multiconfigurational stretched geometries. The clear and simple i-FCIQMC wave functions obtained for these systems are then compared and investigated to demonstrate the dynamic identification of the dominant determinants contributing to significant static correlation. The appearance and nature of such determinants is shown to provide insight into both the i-FCIQMC algorithm and the diatomics themselves.},

	abstract = {The multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory is considered the standard starting point for almost all multireference approaches required for strongly correlated molecular problems. The limitation of the approach is generally given by the number of strongly correlated orbitals in the molecule, since its cost will grow exponentially with this number. We present a new multiconfigurational self-consistent field approach, wherein linear determinant coefficients of a multiconfigurational wave function are optimized via the stochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo technique at greatly reduced computational cost, with nonlinear orbital rotation parameters updated variationally based on this sampled wave function. This extends this approach to strongly correlated systems with far larger active spaces than it is possible to treat via conventional means. By comparison with this traditional approach, we demonstrate that the introduction of stochastic noise in both the determinant amplitudes and the gradient and Hessian of the orbital rotations does not preclude robust and reliable convergence of the orbital optimization. It can even improve the ability to avoid convergence to local minima in the orbital space, and therefore aid in finding variationally lower-energy solutions. We consider the effect on the convergence of the orbitals as the number of walkers and the sampling time within the active space increases, as well as the effect on the final energy and error. The scope of the new protocol is demonstrated with a study of the increasingly strongly correlated electronic structure in a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to the large coronene molecule in a complete active space of 24 π electrons in 24 orbitals, requiring only modest computational resources.},

Our formulation uses the Kirtman-Certain-Hirschfelder canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory, which gives Hermitian effective Hamiltonians at each order, and also allows one to make use of Wigner’s 2n + 1 rule. Further, our formulation satisfies Granovsky’s requirement of model space invariance which is important for obtaining smooth potential energy curves. Thus, when we use MPSPT with the Dyall Hamiltonian, we obtain a model space invariant version of quasi-degenerate n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT), a property that the usual formulation of QD-NEVPT2 based on a multipartitioning technique lacked. We use our method on the benchmark problems of bond breaking of LiF which shows ionic to covalent curve crossing and the twist around the double bond of ethylene where significant valence-Rydberg mixing occurs in the excited states. In accordance with our previous work, we find that multi-reference linearized coupled clustertheory is more accurate than other multi-reference theories of similar cost.},

	abstract = {A multireference second-order perturbation theory (MRPT2) has been developed which allows the use of reference wave functions with large active spaces and arbitrary configuration selection. Internally contracted configurations are used as a basis for all configuration subspaces of the first-order wave function for which the overlap matrix depends only on the second-order density matrix of the reference function. Some other subspaces which would require the third- or fourth-order density matrices are left uncontracted. This removes bottlenecks of the complete active space second order pertubation theory (CASPT2) caused by the need to construct and diagonalize large overlap matrices. Preliminary applications of the new method for 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (DHN) and free base porphin are presented in which the effect of applying occupancy restrictions in the reference wave function (restricted active space second-order perturbation theory, RASPT2) and reference configuration selection (general MRPT2) on electronic excitation energies is tested. In the case of the S 0 –S 1 transition of DHN rapid convergence of the RASPT2 and MRPT2 excitation energies towards the CASPT2 value with increasing number of reference configurations is observed. In the calculations for the lowest five states of porphin all 24 valence π-orbitals were included in the active space of restricted active space self-consistent field (MCSCF) and MRPT2 calculations. From the RASSCF wave functions different subsets of reference configurations were selected on the basis of their coefficients. In this case convergence of the excitation energies with decreasing selection threshold is found to be rather slow, indicating the need for more elaborate selection schemes. The computed excitation energies are in good agreement with previous CASPT2 results obtained with much smaller active spaces.},

Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6981},
	abstract = {For many decades, quantum chemical method development has been dominated by algorithms which involve increasingly complex series of tensor contractions over one-electron orbital spaces. Procedures for their derivation and implementation have evolved to require the minimum amount of logic and rely heavily on computationally efficient library-based matrix algebra and optimized paging schemes. In this regard, the recent development of exact stochastic quantum chemical algorithms to reduce computational scaling and memory overhead requires a contrasting algorithmic philosophy, but one which when implemented efficiently can often achieve higher accuracy/cost ratios with small random errors. Additionally, they can exploit the continuing trend for massive parallelization which hinders the progress of deterministic high-level quantum chemical algorithms. In the Quantum Monte Carlo community, stochastic algorithms are ubiquitous but the discrete Fock space of quantum chemical methods is often unfamiliar, and the methods introduce new concepts required for algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we explore these concepts and detail an algorithm used for Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which is implemented and available in MOLPRO and as a standalone code, and is designed for high-level parallelism and linear-scaling with walker number. Many of the algorithms are also in use in, or can be transferred to, other stochastic quantum chemical methods and implementations. We apply these algorithms to the strongly correlated Chromium dimer, to demonstrate their efficiency and parallelism.},

They differ by the degree of contraction of the outer-space perturbers. Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall’s Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a fixed core field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a CAS. A few test applications of the simplest variant developed in this paper illustrate its potentialities.},

Here, we reliably estimate the vertical excitations of ethene and butadiene by performing FCIQMC calculations for spaces as large as 1018 and 1029 Slater determinants, respectively. For ethene, we obtain a vertical excitation energy in the range 7.89?7.96 eV, depending on the particular equilibrium ground-state geometry employed, and definitely higher than the absorption maximum located at 7.66 eV. For the computationally more challenging case of butadiene, our calculations provide a robust estimate of about 6.3 eV for this excitation, that is, 0.4 eV higher than the corresponding absorption band maximum. Our FCIQMC excitation energies represent a reliable benchmarking reference for future calculations.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schrödinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods—a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O 2 , CH 4 , and NaH—with FCI spaces ranging from 10 9 to 10 14 , whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

	abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N 2 molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10 15 with very modest computational resources.},

	abstract = {A novel stochastic Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) method has been developed and implemented in the Molcas software package. A two-step procedure is used, in which the CAS configuration interaction secular equations are solved stochastically with the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte-Carlo (FCIQMC) approach, while orbital rotations are performed using an approximated form of the Super-CI method. This new method does not suffer from the strong combinatorial limitations of standard MCSCF implementations using direct schemes, and can handle active spaces well in excess of those accessible to traditional CASSCF approaches. The density matrix formulation of the Super-CI method makes this step independent of the size of the CI expansion, depending exclusively on one- and two-body density matrices with indices restricted to the relatively small number of active orbitals. No sigma vectors need to be stored in memory for the FCIQMC eigensolver - a substantial gain in comparison to implementations using the Davidson method, which require three or more vectors of the size of the CI expansion. Further, no orbital Hessian is computed, circumventing limitations on basis set expansions. Like the parent FCIQMC method, the present technique is scalable on massively parallel architectures. We present in this report the method and its application to the free-base porphyrin, the Mg(II) porphyrin and the Fe(II) porphyrin. In the present study, active spaces up to 32 electrons and 29 orbitals in orbital expansions containing up to 916 contracted functions are treated with modest computational resources. Results are quite promising even without accounting for the correlation outside the active space. The systems here presented clearly demonstrate that large CASSCF calculations are possible via FCIQMC-CASSCF without limitations on basis set size.},

It is demonstrated that this leads to a consistent and well defined theory which fulfils all important criteria of a generally applicable ab initio method: The theory is proven numerically and analytically to be size-consistent and invariant with respect to unitary orbital transformations within the inactive, active and virtual orbital spaces. In contrast to most previously proposed multi-reference perturbation theories the necessary condition for a proper perturbation theory to fulfil the zeroth order perturbation equation is exactly satisfied with the RE partitioning itself without additional projectors on configurational spaces. The theory is applied to several excited states of the benchmark systems CH 2 , SiH 2 , and NH 2 , as well as to the lowest states of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms. In all cases comparisons are made with full configuration interaction results. The multi-reference (MR)-RE method is shown to provide very rapidly converging perturbation series.

	abstract = {The choice of a zeroth‐order Hamiltonian, Ĥ0, for second‐order perturbation theory with a complete active space self‐consistent‐field (CASSCF) reference function is discussed in detail, in the context of the inclusion of the denominator shifts found to be important in recent single‐reference high‐spin open‐shell theories and the formulation of a computationally efficient method. Using projection operators and second quantization algebra, an operator is constructed which consists of the complete active space Hamiltonian in the active space and the Mo/ller–Plesset zeroth‐order Hamiltonian in the inactive and secondary spaces. This operator, designated CAS/A, has the reference as an eigenfunction without the necessity of projection, it naturally incorporates denominator shifts which appear in terms of active space Fock operators, it does not give rise to intruder states, and it costs little more than other CASSCF perturbation theories. The incorporation of the complete active space Hamiltonian introduces additional active space two‐particle terms into the zeroth‐order energies over the Fock operators, which may be regarded as an inconsistency. To achieve an approximate consistency, they may be removed or supplemented with other particle–particle and hole–hole terms. The results of test calculations indicate that supplementation is not advisable and that removal has only a modest effect. The test calculations are compared with other results and experiment, and support the effectiveness of the proposed CAS/A Ĥ0.},

	abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

Lett.57, 852 (2002)]10.1209/epl/i2002-00393-0 to quantum chemical Hamiltonians. This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of S ̂ 2 , and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E61, 3199 (2000)]10.1103/PhysRevE.61.3199 where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe2S2, [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, and Cr2 systems. In the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

The positions of the first two triplet states agreed with optical data on solid benzene and threshold electron‐impact experiments. The third triplet state at 5.6 eV was assigned on the basis of the relative intensity of the transition at various scattering angles. The ratio of the intensity of this transition to the allowed singlet–singlet transition at 6.9 eV was in a constant proportion to the corresponding ratio for the first triplet state (3.9 eV) at all scattering angles. The spacings of the first and second and second and third triplet states in benzene were determined to be 0.80 and 0.85 eV. The difference in the spacing is not significant with respect to experimental error.},

	abstract = {Magnets composed of molecular species or polymers and prepared by relatively low-temperature organic synthetic methodologies are a focus of contemporary materials science research. The anticipated properties of such molecular-species-based magnetic materials, particularly in combination with other properties associated with molecules and polymers, may enable their use in future generations of electronic, magnetic, and/or photonic/photronic devices ranging from information storage and magnetic imaging to static and low-frequency magnetic shielding. A tutorial of typical magnetic behavior of molecular materials is presented. The three distinct models (intramolecular spin coupling through orthogonal orbitals in the same spatial region within a molecule/ion, intermolecular spin coupling through pairwise “configuration interaction” between spin-containing moieties, and dipole—dipole, through-space interactions) which enable the design of new molecular-based magnetic materials are discussed. To achieve the required spin couplings for bulk ferro- or ferrimagnetic behavior it is crucial to prepare materials with the necessary primary, secondary, and tertiary structures akin to proteins. Selected results from the worldwide effort aimed at preparing molecular-based magnetic materials by these mechanisms are described. Some organometallic solids comprised of linear chains of alternating metallocenium donors (D) and cyanocarbon acceptors (A) that is, …︁D•+ A•− D•+ A•−…︁, exhibit cooperative magnetic phenomena. Bulk ferromagnetic behavior was first observed below the critical (Curie) temperature Tc of 4.8 K for [FeIII(C5Me5)2]•+ [TCNE]•− (Me = methyl; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene). Replacement of FeIII with MnIII leads to a ferromagnet with a Tc of 8.8 K in agreement with mean-field models developed for this class of materials. Replacement with CrIII, however, leads to a ferromagnet with a Tc lowered to 3.65 K which is at variance with this model. Extension to the reaction of a vanadium(o) complex with TCNE leads to the isolation of a magnet with a Tc ≈ 400 K, which exceeds the thermal decomposition temperature of the material. This demonstrates that a magnetic material with a Tc substantially above room temperature is achievable in a molecule/organic/polymeric material. Finally, a new class of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic materials based on metalloporphins is discussed.},

After corrections for differences in zero-point energies and heat capacities, CASPT2N/6-31G* calculations give ΔEST = 11.0 kcal mol–1 for m-benzoquinodimethane, which is very close to the experimental value of ΔEST = 9.6 ± 0.2 kcal mol–1.

The reasons why substitution of oxygen atoms for one or two methylene groups is predicted to have such a small effect on ΔEST in these three diradicals is discussed. As expected, for 1,3-naphthoquinomethane CASPT2N predicts a value of ΔEST that is only slightly larger than that in m-benzoquinomethane.
