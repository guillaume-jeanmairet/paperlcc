	abstract = {Periodic DFT calculations using plane waves basis sets with the GGA formalism were performed in order to study the behavior of the uranyl ion at the water-Ni(1 1 1) interface. First, the adsorption of water molecules interacting with an optimized surface model has been studied. At low coverage, isolated water molecules adsorb preferentially on top of the surface nickel atoms, the plane defined by the H2O molecule being almost parallel to the surface. When the water coverage increases from 1/9 ML to 2/3 ML (ML = monolayer coverage), hydrogen bonds are created leading to the formation of water hexamers, as suggested experimentally on Ni(1 1 1) and other metallic surfaces [A. Michaelides, A. Alavi, D.A. King, Physical Review B 69 (2004) 113404. M. Nakamura, M. Ito, Chemical Physics Letters 325 (2000) 293-298]. Higher water coverage induces the formation of an additional water layer physisorbed over the cyclic hexamers. In a second step, the behavior of with respect to the hydrated Ni(1 1 1) face has been investigated. Evidence that two adsorption modes can take place was put forward: a first one with an outer sphere adsorption mechanism, where two water molecules of the uranyl ion first hydration shell are shared with four water hexamers, and a second one through a strong Ni-O-yle bond formation. Even though the second surface complex is energetically the most stable, the necessary activation energy to reach it makes it improbable.},

Here, we investigate an approach for the sampling of unbiased reduced density matrices within the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo dynamic, which requires only small computational overheads. This is achieved via an independent replica population of walkers in the dynamic, sampled alongside the original population. The resulting reduced density matrices are free from systematic error (beyond those present via constraints on the dynamic itself) and can be used to compute a variety of expectation values and properties, with rapid convergence to an exact limit. A quasi-variational energy estimate derived from these density matrices is proposed as an accurate alternative to the projected estimator for multiconfigurational wavefunctions, while its variational property could potentially lend itself to accurate extrapolation approaches in larger systems.},

	abstract = {The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics of their constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field of the nuclei. The solution of the underlying many-electron Schrödinger equation is a ‘non-polynomial hard’ problem, owing to the complex interplay of kinetic energy, electron–electron repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. The dominant computational method for describing such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical methods—based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate—have not been fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the ‘gold standard’ coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple particle–hole excitation operators. We show the errors in cohesive energies predicted by this method to be small, indicating the potential of this computationally polynomial scaling technique to tackle current solid-state problems.

	abstract = {A computational scheme is proposed for ab initio calculations of electronic spectra of molecular systems. The scheme is firmly based on the different effects that determine the excitation energies and properties of the excited states. It aims to be accurate to better than 0.5 eV for excitation energies and should provide structural and physical data for the excited states. Applications are possible to rather large molecules (up to 20 atoms) with high-quality basis sets. Extensions of the approach will be possible when direct methods have been implemented. The scheme is based on the CASSCF method, which gives a proper description of the major features in the electronic structure of the excited state, independent of its complexity, and accounts for all near-degeneracy effects and includes full orbital relaxation. Remaining dynamic electron correlation effects are added using second-order perturbation theory with the CASSCF wavefunction as the reference state. The electronic spectrum of the benzene molecule is used as an illustration. Using a (C, 4s3p2d/H, 3s2p) atomic natural orbital basis set, the following excitation energies are obtained (experimental values in parentheses); 1B2u, 4.70 (4.90); 1B1u, 6.10 (6.20); 1E1u, 7.06 (6.94); 1E2g, 7.77 (7.80) eV. The computed oscillator strength for the 1E1u state is 1.05 as compared to the experimental 1.25. Results of similar accuracy are obtained for the triplet states.},

	abstract = {Meta-benzoquinodimethane (MBQDM) or m-xylylene provides a model for larger organic diradicals, the triplet–singlet gap being the key property. In the present work this energy difference has been the object of a systematic study by means of several density functional theory-based methods including B3LYP, M06, M06-2X, HSE and LC-ωPBE potentials and a variety of wave function-based methods such as complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF), Multireference second-order Møller–Plesset (MRMP), difference dedicated configuration interaction (DDCI), and Multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). In each case various basis sets of increasing quality have been explored, and the effect of the molecular geometry is also analyzed. The use of the triplet and broken symmetry (BS) solutions for the corresponding optimized geometries obtained from B3LYP and especially M06-2X functionals provide the value of the adiabatic triplet–singlet gap closer to experiment when compared to the reported value of Wenthold, Kim, and Lineberger, (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 1354) and also for the electron affinity. The agreement further improves using the full π-valence CASSCF(8,8) optimized geometry as an attempt to correct for the spin contamination effects on the geometry of the BS state. The CASSCF, MRMP, and MRCI, even with the full π valence CAS(8,8) as reference and relatively large basis set, systematically overestimate the experimental value indicating either that an accurate description must go beyond this level of theory, including σ electrons and higher order polarization functions, or perhaps that the measured value is affected by the experimental conditions.},

Here, we use this technique to elucidate an often troublesome series of first-row diatomics consisting of Be2, C2, CN, CO, N2, NO, O2, and F2. Using i-FCIQMC, the dissociation energies of these molecules are obtained almost entirely to within chemical accuracy of experimental results. Furthermore, the i-FCIQMC calculations are performed in a relatively black-box manner, without any a priori knowledge or specification of the wave function. The size consistency of i-FCIQMC is also demonstrated with regards to these diatomics at their more multiconfigurational stretched geometries. The clear and simple i-FCIQMC wave functions obtained for these systems are then compared and investigated to demonstrate the dynamic identification of the dominant determinants contributing to significant static correlation. The appearance and nature of such determinants is shown to provide insight into both the i-FCIQMC algorithm and the diatomics themselves.},

	abstract = {The multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory is considered the standard starting point for almost all multireference approaches required for strongly correlated molecular problems. The limitation of the approach is generally given by the number of strongly correlated orbitals in the molecule, since its cost will grow exponentially with this number. We present a new multiconfigurational self-consistent field approach, wherein linear determinant coefficients of a multiconfigurational wave function are optimized via the stochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo technique at greatly reduced computational cost, with nonlinear orbital rotation parameters updated variationally based on this sampled wave function. This extends this approach to strongly correlated systems with far larger active spaces than it is possible to treat via conventional means. By comparison with this traditional approach, we demonstrate that the introduction of stochastic noise in both the determinant amplitudes and the gradient and Hessian of the orbital rotations does not preclude robust and reliable convergence of the orbital optimization. It can even improve the ability to avoid convergence to local minima in the orbital space, and therefore aid in finding variationally lower-energy solutions. We consider the effect on the convergence of the orbitals as the number of walkers and the sampling time within the active space increases, as well as the effect on the final energy and error. The scope of the new protocol is demonstrated with a study of the increasingly strongly correlated electronic structure in a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to the large coronene molecule in a complete active space of 24 π electrons in 24 orbitals, requiring only modest computational resources.},

Our formulation uses the Kirtman-Certain-Hirschfelder canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory, which gives Hermitian effective Hamiltonians at each order, and also allows one to make use of Wigner’s 2n + 1 rule. Further, our formulation satisfies Granovsky’s requirement of model space invariance which is important for obtaining smooth potential energy curves. Thus, when we use MPSPT with the Dyall Hamiltonian, we obtain a model space invariant version of quasi-degenerate n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT), a property that the usual formulation of QD-NEVPT2 based on a multipartitioning technique lacked. We use our method on the benchmark problems of bond breaking of LiF which shows ionic to covalent curve crossing and the twist around the double bond of ethylene where significant valence-Rydberg mixing occurs in the excited states. In accordance with our previous work, we find that multi-reference linearized coupled clustertheory is more accurate than other multi-reference theories of similar cost.},

	abstract = {A multireference second-order perturbation theory (MRPT2) has been developed which allows the use of reference wave functions with large active spaces and arbitrary configuration selection. Internally contracted configurations are used as a basis for all configuration subspaces of the first-order wave function for which the overlap matrix depends only on the second-order density matrix of the reference function. Some other subspaces which would require the third- or fourth-order density matrices are left uncontracted. This removes bottlenecks of the complete active space second order pertubation theory (CASPT2) caused by the need to construct and diagonalize large overlap matrices. Preliminary applications of the new method for 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (DHN) and free base porphin are presented in which the effect of applying occupancy restrictions in the reference wave function (restricted active space second-order perturbation theory, RASPT2) and reference configuration selection (general MRPT2) on electronic excitation energies is tested. In the case of the S 0 –S 1 transition of DHN rapid convergence of the RASPT2 and MRPT2 excitation energies towards the CASPT2 value with increasing number of reference configurations is observed. In the calculations for the lowest five states of porphin all 24 valence π-orbitals were included in the active space of restricted active space self-consistent field (MCSCF) and MRPT2 calculations. From the RASSCF wave functions different subsets of reference configurations were selected on the basis of their coefficients. In this case convergence of the excitation energies with decreasing selection threshold is found to be rather slow, indicating the need for more elaborate selection schemes. The computed excitation energies are in good agreement with previous CASPT2 results obtained with much smaller active spaces.},

Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate.

	abstract = {For many decades, quantum chemical method development has been dominated by algorithms which involve increasingly complex series of tensor contractions over one-electron orbital spaces. Procedures for their derivation and implementation have evolved to require the minimum amount of logic and rely heavily on computationally efficient library-based matrix algebra and optimized paging schemes. In this regard, the recent development of exact stochastic quantum chemical algorithms to reduce computational scaling and memory overhead requires a contrasting algorithmic philosophy, but one which when implemented efficiently can often achieve higher accuracy/cost ratios with small random errors. Additionally, they can exploit the continuing trend for massive parallelization which hinders the progress of deterministic high-level quantum chemical algorithms. In the Quantum Monte Carlo community, stochastic algorithms are ubiquitous but the discrete Fock space of quantum chemical methods is often unfamiliar, and the methods introduce new concepts required for algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we explore these concepts and detail an algorithm used for Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which is implemented and available in MOLPRO and as a standalone code, and is designed for high-level parallelism and linear-scaling with walker number. Many of the algorithms are also in use in, or can be transferred to, other stochastic quantum chemical methods and implementations. We apply these algorithms to the strongly correlated Chromium dimer, to demonstrate their efficiency and parallelism.},

They differ by the degree of contraction of the outer-space perturbers. Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall’s Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a fixed core field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a CAS. A few test applications of the simplest variant developed in this paper illustrate its potentialities.},

Here, we reliably estimate the vertical excitations of ethene and butadiene by performing FCIQMC calculations for spaces as large as 1018 and 1029 Slater determinants, respectively. For ethene, we obtain a vertical excitation energy in the range 7.89?7.96 eV, depending on the particular equilibrium ground-state geometry employed, and definitely higher than the absorption maximum located at 7.66 eV. For the computationally more challenging case of butadiene, our calculations provide a robust estimate of about 6.3 eV for this excitation, that is, 0.4 eV higher than the corresponding absorption band maximum. Our FCIQMC excitation energies represent a reliable benchmarking reference for future calculations.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schrödinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods—a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O 2 , CH 4 , and NaH—with FCI spaces ranging from 10 9 to 10 14 , whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

	abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N 2 molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10 15 with very modest computational resources.},

	abstract = {A novel stochastic Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) method has been developed and implemented in the Molcas software package. A two-step procedure is used, in which the CAS configuration interaction secular equations are solved stochastically with the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte-Carlo (FCIQMC) approach, while orbital rotations are performed using an approximated form of the Super-CI method. This new method does not suffer from the strong combinatorial limitations of standard MCSCF implementations using direct schemes, and can handle active spaces well in excess of those accessible to traditional CASSCF approaches. The density matrix formulation of the Super-CI method makes this step independent of the size of the CI expansion, depending exclusively on one- and two-body density matrices with indices restricted to the relatively small number of active orbitals. No sigma vectors need to be stored in memory for the FCIQMC eigensolver - a substantial gain in comparison to implementations using the Davidson method, which require three or more vectors of the size of the CI expansion. Further, no orbital Hessian is computed, circumventing limitations on basis set expansions. Like the parent FCIQMC method, the present technique is scalable on massively parallel architectures. We present in this report the method and its application to the free-base porphyrin, the Mg(II) porphyrin and the Fe(II) porphyrin. In the present study, active spaces up to 32 electrons and 29 orbitals in orbital expansions containing up to 916 contracted functions are treated with modest computational resources. Results are quite promising even without accounting for the correlation outside the active space. The systems here presented clearly demonstrate that large CASSCF calculations are possible via FCIQMC-CASSCF without limitations on basis set size.},

A straightforward extension of the DMRG algorithm is proposed with further improvements and aggressive optimizations to allow its application with large multireference active space, which is often demanded for metal compound calculations. Special efficiency is achieved by making better use of sparsity and symmetry in the operator and wave function representations. By accomplishing computationally intensive DMRG calculations, the authors have found that a large number of renormalized basis states are required to represent high entanglement of the electron correlation for metal compound applications, and it is crucial to adopt auxiliary perturbative correction to the projected density matrix during the DMRG sweep optimization in order to attain proper convergence to the solution. Potential energy curve calculations for the Cr 2 molecule near the known equilibrium precisely predicted the full configuration interaction energies with a correlation space of 24 electrons in 30 orbitals [denoted by ( 24 e , 30 o ) ]. The energies are demonstrated to be accurate to 0.6 m E h (the error from the extrapolated best value) when as many as 10 000 renormalized basis states are employed for the left and right DMRG block representations. The relative energy curves for [ Cu 2 O 2 ] 2 + along the isomerization coordinate were obtained from DMRG and other correlated calculations, for which a fairly large orbital space ( 32 e , 62 o ) is modeled as a full correlation space. The DMRG prediction nearly overlaps with the energy curve from the coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)] calculations, while the multireference complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations with the small reference configuration ( 8 e , 8 o ) are found to overestimate the biradical character of the electronic state of [ Cu 2 O 2 ] 2 + according to the one-electron density matrix analysis.},

In contrast to traditional approaches, this algorithm is believed to yield arbitrarily high accuracy in the energy with only polynomial computational effort. We describe in some detail how this is achieved. We begin by introducing the principles of the renormalization procedure, and how one formulates an algorithm for use in quantum chemistry. The renormalization group algorithm is then interpreted in terms of familiar quantum chemical concepts, and its numerical behavior, including its convergence and computational cost, are studied using both model and real systems. The asymptotic convergence of the algorithm is derived. Finally, we examine the performance of the DMRG on widely studied chemical problems, such as the water molecule, the twisting barrier of ethene, and the dissociation of nitrogen. In all cases, the results compare favorably with the best existing quantum chemical methods, and particularly so when the nondynamical correlation is strong.

	abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group algorithm has emerged as a promising new method in ab initio quantum chemistry. However, many problems still need to be solved before this method can be applied routinely. At the start of such a calculation, the orbitals originating from a preceding quantum chemical calculation must be placed in a specific order on a one-dimensional lattice. This ordering affects the convergence of the density-matrix renormalization group iterations significantly. In this paper, we present two approaches to obtain optimized orderings of the orbitals. First, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the ordering with respect to a low total electronic energy obtained at a predefined stage of the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm with a given number of total states kept. In addition to that, we derive orderings from the one- and two-electron integrals of our test system. This test molecule is the chromium dimer, which is known to possess a complicated electronic structure. For this molecule, we have carried out calculations for the various orbital orderings obtained. The convergence behavior of the density-matrix renormalization group iterations is discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has become an indispensable numerical tool to find exact eigenstates of finite-size quantum systems with strong correlation. In the fields of condensed matter, nuclear structure and molecular electronic structure, it has significantly extended the system sizes that can be handled compared to full configuration interaction, without losing numerical accuracy. For quantum chemistry (QC), the most efficient implementations of DMRG require the incorporation of particle number, spin and point group symmetries in the underlying matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, as well as the use of so-called complementary operators. The symmetries introduce a sparse block structure in the MPS ansatz and in the intermediary contracted tensors. If a symmetry is non-abelian, the Wigner–Eckart theorem allows to factorize a tensor into a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor. In addition, the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked. Because of these challenges, implementing DMRG efficiently for QC is not straightforward. Efficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired. In this work we present CheMPS2, our free open-source spin-adapted implementation of DMRG for ab initio QC. Around CheMPS2, we have implemented the augmented Hessian Newton–Raphson complete active space self-consistent field method, with exact Hessian. The bond dissociation curves of the 12 lowest states of the carbon dimer were obtained at the DMRG(28 orbitals, 12 electrons, D SU(2) = 2500 )/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The contribution of 1 s core correlation to the X 1 Σ g + bond dissociation curve of the carbon dimer was estimated by comparing energies at the DMRG(36o, 12e, D SU(2) = 2500 )/cc-pCVDZ and DMRG-SCF(34o, 8e, D SU(2) = 2500 )/cc-pCVDZ levels of theory.

Nature of problem:

The many-body Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of single-particle states. Exact diagonalization solvers can therefore only handle small systems, of up to 18 electrons in 18 orbitals. Interesting active spaces are often significantly larger.

Solution method:

The density matrix renormalization group allows the extension of the size of active spaces, for which numerically exact solutions can be found, to about 40 electrons in 40 orbitals. In addition, it provides a rigorous variational upper bound to energies, as it has an underlying wavefunction ansatz, the matrix product state.

Restrictions:

Our implementation of the density matrix renormalization group is spin-adapted. This means that targeted eigenstates in the active space are exact eigenstates of the total electronic spin operator. Hamiltonians which break this symmetry (a magnetic field term for example) cannot be handled by our code. As electron repulsion integrals in Gaussian basis sets have eightfold permutation symmetry, we have used this property in our code.

Unusual features:

The nature of the matrix product state ansatz allows for exact spin coupling. In CheMPS2, the total electronic spin is imposed (not just the spin projection), in addition to the particle-number and abelian point-group symmetries.

Running time:

The running time depends on the size of the targeted active space, the number of desired eigenstates, their symmetry, the density of states, the individual orbital symmetries, the orbital ordering, the desired level of convergence, and the chosen convergence scheme. To converge a single point of one of the dissociation curves of the carbon dimer ( D ∞ h → D 2 h symmetry) in the cc-pVDZ basis (28 orbitals; their ordering is described in Section  5.3) with 2500 reduced renormalized basis states (see the convergence scheme in Section  5.4; the variational energy then lies 0.1 m E h above the fully converged result) takes about 8 h on a single node with a dual-socket octa-core Intel Xeon Sandy Bridge (E5-2670) (16 cores at 2.6 GHz), and requires 6 GB of RAM.},

The generalised van Vleck perturbation theory is employed to set up the perturbation equations. It is demonstrated that this leads to a consistent and well defined theory which fulfils all important criteria of a generally applicable ab initio method: The theory is proven numerically and analytically to be size-consistent and invariant with respect to unitary orbital transformations within the inactive, active and virtual orbital spaces. In contrast to most previously proposed multi-reference perturbation theories the necessary condition for a proper perturbation theory to fulfil the zeroth order perturbation equation is exactly satisfied with the RE partitioning itself without additional projectors on configurational spaces. The theory is applied to several excited states of the benchmark systems CH 2 , SiH 2 , and NH 2 , as well as to the lowest states of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms. In all cases comparisons are made with full configuration interaction results. The multi-reference (MR)-RE method is shown to provide very rapidly converging perturbation series.

Using projection operators and second quantization algebra, an operator is constructed which consists of the complete active space Hamiltonian in the active space and the Mo/ller–Plesset zeroth‐order Hamiltonian in the inactive and secondary spaces. This operator, designated CAS/A, has the reference as an eigenfunction without the necessity of projection, it naturally incorporates denominator shifts which appear in terms of active space Fock operators, it does not give rise to intruder states, and it costs little more than other CASSCF perturbation theories. The incorporation of the complete active space Hamiltonian introduces additional active space two‐particle terms into the zeroth‐order energies over the Fock operators, which may be regarded as an inconsistency. To achieve an approximate consistency, they may be removed or supplemented with other particle–particle and hole–hole terms. The results of test calculations indicate that supplementation is not advisable and that removal has only a modest effect. The test calculations are compared with other results and experiment, and support the effectiveness of the proposed CAS/A Ĥ0.},

Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

Lett.57, 852 (2002)]10.1209/epl/i2002-00393-0 to quantum chemical Hamiltonians. This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of S ̂ 2 , and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E61, 3199 (2000)]10.1103/PhysRevE.61.3199 where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe2S2, [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, and Cr2 systems. In the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

The positions of the first two triplet states agreed with optical data on solid benzene and threshold electron‐impact experiments. The third triplet state at 5.6 eV was assigned on the basis of the relative intensity of the transition at various scattering angles. The ratio of the intensity of this transition to the allowed singlet–singlet transition at 6.9 eV was in a constant proportion to the corresponding ratio for the first triplet state (3.9 eV) at all scattering angles. The spacings of the first and second and second and third triplet states in benzene were determined to be 0.80 and 0.85 eV. The difference in the spacing is not significant with respect to experimental error.},

	abstract = {Magnets composed of molecular species or polymers and prepared by relatively low-temperature organic synthetic methodologies are a focus of contemporary materials science research. The anticipated properties of such molecular-species-based magnetic materials, particularly in combination with other properties associated with molecules and polymers, may enable their use in future generations of electronic, magnetic, and/or photonic/photronic devices ranging from information storage and magnetic imaging to static and low-frequency magnetic shielding. A tutorial of typical magnetic behavior of molecular materials is presented. The three distinct models (intramolecular spin coupling through orthogonal orbitals in the same spatial region within a molecule/ion, intermolecular spin coupling through pairwise “configuration interaction” between spin-containing moieties, and dipole—dipole, through-space interactions) which enable the design of new molecular-based magnetic materials are discussed. To achieve the required spin couplings for bulk ferro- or ferrimagnetic behavior it is crucial to prepare materials with the necessary primary, secondary, and tertiary structures akin to proteins. Selected results from the worldwide effort aimed at preparing molecular-based magnetic materials by these mechanisms are described. Some organometallic solids comprised of linear chains of alternating metallocenium donors (D) and cyanocarbon acceptors (A) that is, …︁D•+ A•− D•+ A•−…︁, exhibit cooperative magnetic phenomena. Bulk ferromagnetic behavior was first observed below the critical (Curie) temperature Tc of 4.8 K for [FeIII(C5Me5)2]•+ [TCNE]•− (Me = methyl; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene). Replacement of FeIII with MnIII leads to a ferromagnet with a Tc of 8.8 K in agreement with mean-field models developed for this class of materials. Replacement with CrIII, however, leads to a ferromagnet with a Tc lowered to 3.65 K which is at variance with this model. Extension to the reaction of a vanadium(o) complex with TCNE leads to the isolation of a magnet with a Tc ≈ 400 K, which exceeds the thermal decomposition temperature of the material. This demonstrates that a magnetic material with a Tc substantially above room temperature is achievable in a molecule/organic/polymeric material. Finally, a new class of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic materials based on metalloporphins is discussed.},

The active modes are assigned to α-carbon bending, ring deformation, and methylene bending, respectively.

In contrast, CASSCF and CASPT2N/6-31G* calculations predict only small changes in ΔEST on substituting oxygen atoms for one or two methylene groups in m-benzoquinodimethane. After corrections for differences in zero-point energies and heat capacities, CASPT2N/6-31G* calculations give ΔEST = 11.0 kcal mol–1 for m-benzoquinodimethane, which is very close to the experimental value of ΔEST = 9.6 ± 0.2 kcal mol–1. At the same level of theory ΔEST = 9.3 and 11.8 kcal mol–1 are computed for, respectively, m-benzoquinomethane and m-benzoquinone. The reasons why substitution of oxygen atoms for one or two methylene groups is predicted to have such a small effect on ΔEST in these three diradicals is discussed. As expected, for 1,3-naphthoquinomethane CASPT2N predicts a value of ΔEST that is only slightly larger than that in m-benzoquinomethane. However, the calculated value of ΔEST = 11.6 kcal mol–1 is 7 kcal mol–1 lower than the value measured by photoacoustic calorimetry.},

	abstract = {The complete active space (CAS) SCF method is presented in detail with special emphasis on computational aspects. The CASSCF wave function is formed from a complete distribution of a number of active electrons in a set of active orbitals, which in general constitute a subset of the total occupied space. In contrast to other MCSCF schemes, a CASSCF calculation involves no selection of individual configurations, and the wave function therefore typically consists of a large number of terms. The largest case treated here includes 10 416 spin and space adapted configurations. To be able to treat such large CI expansions, a density‐matrix oriented formalism is used. The Newton–Raphson scheme is applied to calculate the orbital rotations, and the secular problem is solved with recent developments of CI techniques. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in calculations on the HNO molecule in ground and excited states, using a triple‐zeta basis and different sizes of the active space. With a reasonable choice of active space, the calculations converge in 6–10 iterations. This is true also for states which are not the lowest state of the symmetry in question. The equilibrium geometry for the ground state is R NO=1.215(1.212) Å, R NH =1.079(1.063) Å, ϑHNO=108.8(108.6) °, the experimental values given in parenthesis for comparison. The best estimates for the transition energies to the lowest 3 A ″ and 1 A ″ states are 0.67(0.85) eV and 1.52(1.63) eV, respectively. The results obtained indicate that the choice of active space may be crucial for the convergence properties of CASSCF calculations.},

	abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1Σ+g, 3Σ+u and 3Πg) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) Å; ωe: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses).

A multiconfigurational self-consistent-field (MCSCF) wave function with correct spin and space symmetry is used to compute the total electronic density, its gradient, the on-top pair density, and the kinetic and Coulomb contributions to the total electronic energy. We then use a functional of the total density, its gradient, and the on-top pair density to calculate the remaining part of the energy, which we call the on-top-density-functional energy in contrast to the exchange-correlation energy of Kohn–Sham DFT. Because the on-top pair density is an element of the two-particle density matrix, this goes beyond the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem that refers only to the one-particle density. To illustrate the theory, we obtain first approximations to the required new type of density functionals by translating conventional density functionals of the spin densities using a simple prescription, and we perform post-SCF density functional calculations using the total density, density gradient, and on-top pair density from the MCSCF calculations. Double counting of dynamic correlation or exchange does not occur because the MCSCF energy is not used. The theory is illustrated by applications to the bond energies and potential energy curves of H2, N2, F2, CaO, Cr2, and NiCl and the electronic excitation energies of Be, C, N, N+, O, O+, Sc+, Mn, Co, Mo, Ru, N2, HCHO, C4H6, c-C5H6, and pyrazine. The method presented has a computational cost and scaling similar to MCSCF, but a quantitative accuracy, even with the present first approximations to the new types of density functionals, that is comparable to much more expensive multireference perturbation theory methods.},

The major features are: (1) The intermediate summation over determinants is replaced by two intermediate summations over strings, the number of which is only the square root of the number of determinants. (2) Intermediate summations over strings outside the RAS CI space is avoided and RAS calculations are therefore almost as efficient as full CI calculations with the same number of determinants. (3) An additional simplification is devised for M S =0 states, halving the number of operations.

Kurashige and T. Yanai, J. Chem. Phys.135, 094104 (2011)]. In the previous study, the combined theory, referred to as DMRG-CASPT2, was built upon the use of pseudo-canonical molecular orbitals (PCMOs) for one-electron basis. Within the PCMO basis, the construction of the four-particle reduced density matrix (4-RDM) using DMRG can be greatly facilitated because of simplicity in the multiplication of 4-RDM and diagonal Fock matrix in the CASPT2 equation. In this work, we develop an approach to use more suited orbital basis in DMRG-CASPT2 calculations, e.g., localized molecular orbitals, in order to extend the domain of applicability. Because the multiplication of 4-RDM and generalized Fock matrix is no longer simple in general orbitals, an approximation is made to it using the cumulant reconstruction neglecting higher-particle cumulants. Also, we present the details of the algorithm to compute 3-RDM of the DMRG wavefunction as an extension of the 2-RDM algorithm of Zgid et al. [J. Chem. Phys.128, 144115 (2008)] and Chan et al. [J.

The method reproduces the solution of the complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) when the DMRG reference function is represented by a sufficiently large number of renormalized many-body basis, thereby being named DMRG-CASPT2 method. The DMRG-SCF is able to describe non-dynamical correlation with large active space that is insurmountable to the conventional CASSCF method, while the second-order perturbation theory provides an efficient description of dynamical correlation effects. The capability of our implementation is demonstrated for an application to the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer, which is one of the most demanding multireference systems that require best electronic structure treatment for non-dynamical and dynamical correlation as well as large basis sets. The DMRG-CASPT2/cc-pwCV5Z calculations were performed with a large (3d double-shell) active space consisting of 28 orbitals. Our approach using large-size DMRG reference addressed the problems of why the dissociation energy is largely overestimated by CASPT2 with the small active space consisting of 12 orbitals (3d4s), and also is oversensitive to the choice of the zeroth-order Hamiltonian.},

For the current system, chemically accurate results can be obtained with a relatively small number of renormalized states. The nature and vertical excitation energies of the excited (S1 and S2) states are consistent with conventional CAS(or RAS)PT2 with medium active spaces. The capability of the DMRG-CASSCF method in the optimization of molecular geometry is demonstrated for the first time. The computation costs (several hours per optimization cycle) are comparable with that of the conventional CASSCF geometry optimization with small active space.

	abstract = {We report development of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method that can use active space scalable to much larger size references than has previously been possible. The recent development of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method in multireference quantum chemistry offers the ability to describe static correlation in a large active space. The present MRCI method provides a critical correction to the DMRG reference by including high-level dynamic correlation through the CI treatment. When the DMRG and MRCI theories are combined (DMRG-MRCI), the full internal contraction of the reference in the MRCI ansatz, including contraction of semi-internal states, plays a central role. However, it is thought to involve formidable complexity because of the presence of the five-particle rank reduced-density matrix (RDM) in the Hamiltonian matrix elements. To address this complexity, we express the Hamiltonian matrix using commutators, which allows the five-particle rank RDM to be canceled out without any approximation. Then we introduce an approximation to the four-particle rank RDM by using a cumulant reconstruction from lower-particle rank RDMs. A computer-aided approach is employed to derive the exceedingly complex equations of the MRCI in tensor-contracted form and to implement them into an efficient parallel computer code. This approach extends to the size-consistency-corrected variants of MRCI, such as the MRCI+Q, MR-ACPF, and MR-AQCC methods. We demonstrate the capability of the DMRG-MRCI method in several benchmark applications, including the evaluation of single-triplet gap of free-base porphyrin using 24 active orbitals.},

The previous implementation achieved the MRCI calculations with the active space (24e,24o), which are deemed the record largest, whereas the inherent Nact8 × N complexity of computation was found a hindrance to using further large active space. In this study, an extended optimization of the tensor contractions is developed by explicitly incorporating the rank reduction of the decomposed form of the cumulant-approximated 4-RDM into the factorization. It reduces the computational scaling (to Nact7 × N) as well as the cache-miss penalty associated with direct evaluation of complex cumulant reconstruction. The present scheme, however, faces the increased complexity of factorization patterns for optimally implementing the tensor contraction terms involving the decomposed 4-RDM objects. We address this complexity using the enhanced symbolic manipulation computer program for deriving and coding programmable equations. The new DMRG-MRCI implementation is applied to the determination of the stability of the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin relative to the iron(V) electronic isomer (electromer) using the active space (29e,29o) (including four second d-shell orbitals of iron) with triple-ζ-quality atomic orbital basis sets. The DMRG-cu(4)-MRCI+Q model is shown to favor the triradicaloid iron(IV)-oxo state as the lowest energy state and characterize the iron(V) electromer as thermally inaccessible, supporting the earlier experimental and density functional studies. This conflicts with the previous MR calculations using the restricted active-space second-order perturbation theory (RASPT2) with the similar-size active space (29e,28o) reported by Pierloot et al. (Radoń, M.; Broclawik, E.; Pierloot, K. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011, 7, 898), showing that the hypothetical iron(V) state indicated by recent laser flash photolysis (LFP) studies is likely thermally accessible because of its underestimated relative energy.},

	abstract = {A generalization of normal ordering and of Wick’s theorem with respect to an arbitrary reference function Φ as some generalized “physical vacuum” is formulated in a different (but essentially equivalent) way than that suggested previously by one of the present authors. Guiding principles are that normal order operators with respect to any reference state must be expressible as linear combinations of those with respect to the genuine vacuum, that the vacuum expectation value of a normal order operator must vanish (with respect to the vacuum to which it is in normal order), and that the well-known formalism for a single Slater determinant as physical vacuum must be contained as a special case. The derivation is largely based on the concepts of “Quantum Chemistry in Fock space,” which means that particle-number-conserving operators (excitation operators) play a central role. Nevertheless, the contraction rules in the frame of a generalized Wick theorem are derived, that hold for non-particle-number-conserving operators as well. The contraction rules are formulated and illustrated in terms of diagrams. The contractions involve the “residual n -particle density matrices” λ , which are the irreducible (non-factorizable) parts of the conventional n -particle density matrices γ , in the sense of a cumulant expansion for the density. A spinfree formulation is presented as well. The expression of the Hamiltonian in normal order with respect to a multiconfiguration reference function leads to a natural definition of a generalized Fock operator. MC-SCF-theory is easily worked out in this context. The paper concludes with a discussion of the excited configurations and the first-order interacting space, that underlies a perturbative coupled cluster type correction to the MCSCF function for an arbitrary reference function, and with general implications of the new formalism, that is related to “internally contracted multireference configuration interaction.” The present generalization of normal ordering is not only valid for arbitrary reference functions, but also if the reference state is an ensemble state.},

It is now almost commonplace to publish an experimental paper together with quantum chemical calculations. The calculations serve either to validate the conclusions that have been reached from the analysis of the experiments or to distinguish between those possibilities that were left open. In addition, there are many purely theoretical investigations which address various structural and mechanistic aspects of metalloprotein structure and function. In this context the term ‘quantum chemical methods’ has been applied almost synonymously with density functional theory (DFT). Despite the enormous popularity of DFT in bioinorganic chemistry, one frequently voiced complaint from the experimental community is that the calculations often take too little or no notice of the available experimental results.

In this method, the correlation correction expressions are recast into high-dimensional integrals, which are approximated as the sums of integrands evaluated at coordinates of four electron random walkers guided by a Metropolis algorithm for importance sampling. The gravest drawback of this method, however, is the inevitable statistical uncertainties in its results, which decay slowly as the inverse square-root of the number of MC steps. We propose an algorithm that can increase the number of MC sampling points in each MC step by many orders of magnitude by having 2m electron walkers (m {\textgreater} 2) and then using m(m – 1)/2 permutations of their coordinates in evaluating the integrands. Hence, this algorithm brings an O(m2)-fold increase in the number of MC sampling points at a mere O(m) additional cost of propagating redundant walkers, which is a net O(m)-fold enhancement in sampling efficiency. We have demonstrated a large performance increase in the Monte Carlo MP2 calculations for the correlation energies of benzene and benzene dimer as well as for the correlation corrections to the energy, ionization potential, and electron affinity of C60. The calculation for C60 has been performed with a parallel implementation of this method running on up to 400 processors of a supercomputer, yielding an accurate prediction of its large electron affinity, which makes its derivative useful as an electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.},
