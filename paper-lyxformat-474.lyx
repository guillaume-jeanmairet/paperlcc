\begin_layout Abstract
In this article we report a joint use of the FCIQMC method with the recently
 proposed LCC multireference perturbation theory.
 In that method both the zeroth order and first order wavefunctions are
 sampled stochastically by propagating a population of signed walkers.
 Practically this is done by propagating the different populations simultaneousl
y.
 The zeroth order wavefunction follows a dynamic obeying to stochastic processes
 identical to the one used in the FCIQMC.
 On the other the computation of the perturbation requires to propose new
 rules for the stochastic process, in particular it is mandatory to introduce
 a source term coming from the zeroth order wavefunction.
 With this fully stochastic method, in will become possible to treat simultaneou
sly large active spaces to account for the static correlation and a huge
 number of inactive orbitals to account for the dynamical correlation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To illustrate the method, we study a few organic molecules, going from carbon
 dimer to aromatic molecules.
 We computed singlet-triplet gaps of benzene and m-xylylene.
 In particular, for m-xylylene we found a gap in good agreement with the
 experimental value while Illias et collaborators have recently shown that
 this gap was hard to recover using CASSCF+PT techniques.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most challenging topics in electronic structure theory is how
 to deal with realistic strongly correlated electronic systems, which typically
 exhibit combinatorial complexity in the description of the ground-state
 wavefunction.
 Because the full problem is usually to hard to deal with, strong correllation
 is usually treated by the use of multireference approaches such as configuratio
n interaction (CI), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or configuration
 interaction quantum monte-carlo (FCIQMC).
 Those techniques generally scale exponentially in the number of correlating
 orbitals and do not provide size-extensive energies (except in unreachable
 exact limits).
 On the other hand weak correlation is usually dealt with many-body perturbation
 theory and coupled cluster theory, but they tends to fail since they are
 build upon a single reference wavefunction which is a too crude approximation
 for highly corelated systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We proposed here the combined use of the FCIQMC method that is able to deal
 the highly-multireference caracter of large active spaces and of multireference
 linearized coupled cluster (MRLCC) pertrubation theory to deal with the
 dynamical correlation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the originility of this work is that the perturbation is treated
 stochastically, by a walkers dynamic that mimic the projection equations
 of MRPT, the resulting method is tthus named QMC-LCC.
 Another originality is that the sampling of zeroth and first order wavefunction
s are done simultaneously while standard method usally compute the response
 after the calculation of the zeroth order wavefunction by the use of projection
 techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structure of the rest of this article is the following, in the next
 part we will recall the governing equations of multireference perturbation
 theories (MRPT), with a particular emphasisis on the LCC method.
 We also recall some basics of the FCIQMC methods before showing how the
 MR-LCC can be expressed in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

FCIQMC language

,

 as the stochastic progation of a walkers populations dynamics.
 In the third part a describtion of the algortihmic of the QMC-LCC method
 that has been implemented in the neci code is given, we also discuss some
 important technical points.
 We then illustrate the potential of appliying to some organic molecules.
 We first test the method by studying the carbon dimer with sytematically
 more refined basis set, going from ccpv-dz to ccpv-qz.
 Afterwards we turn our attention to the evaluation of Singlet-Triplet gaps.
 First in the case of a singlet ground state with the benzene molecule,
 and then in the case of a triplet ground state with the m-xylylene diradical.

\begin_layout Standard
The essence of most quantum-mechanical perturbation theories is to split
 the total Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}$
\end_inset

, into the sum of a simpler Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 and a perturbation operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}=\hat{H_{0}}+\hat{V},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}=\hat{H}-\hat{H_{0}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The zero order order energy and wavefunctions, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 are solution of the following eigenproblem,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{H_{0}}\Ket{\Psi_{0}}=E_{0}\Ket{\Psi_{0}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is assumed to be possible to solve exactly, that is generally the
 case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In multireference perturbation theories, the zeroth order wavefunction is
 expressed as a linear combination of slater deterninants 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Ket{\Psi_{0}}=\sum_{i}C_{i}D_{i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where the expansion set of determinants 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \Ket{D_{i}}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is chosen to recover most of the correlation.
 Usually the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \Ket{D_{i}}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a CASCI space, it then contains all interactions between active electrons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is not unique since several operators will admit the CASCI wavefunction
 as an eigenvector.
 Among the most popular ones we can mention the Fock operator used in CAS-PT2,
 the Dyall Hamiltonian used in NEVPT2 and the excitation conserving Hamiltonian
 of Fink used in the recently proposed MPS-LCC theory.
 Since MRLCC seems to outperformed other methods of similar cost, we will
 focus on that one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we split the the orbitals into an active set where the orbital occupancies
 can be 0, 1 or 2, a core set where the orbitals are doubly occupied and
 a virtual set of empty orbitals then the Fink Halmitonian can be expressed
 in second quantization as,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}=\sum_{ij}t_{ij}a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j}+\sum_{ijkl}\Braket{ij|kl}a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{l}a_{k}\label{eq:H@ndQ}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{H_{0}}=\sum_{{ij;\atop \Delta n=(0,0,0)}}t_{ij}a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j}+\sum_{{ijkl;\atop \Delta n=(0,0,0)}}\Braket{ij|kl}a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{l}a_{k}\label{eq:HFink}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k,l$
\end_inset

 refer to any orbitals, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n$
\end_inset

 denotes the change in the total number of electrons between the three subsets
 of orbitals, i.e.
 the only operators belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 are the ones that do not transfer electrons between the different subsets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The successive correction (
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{m}}$
\end_inset

) to the zeroth order wavefuntion can be computed by using the following
 equation,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\hat{H_{0}}-E_{0}\right)\Ket{\Psi_{m}}=-Q\left(\hat{V}\Ket{\Psi_{m-1}}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}E_{k}\Ket{\Psi_{m-k}}\right)\label{eq:bthorderwf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the projector onto the orthogonal space of the zeroth order wavefunction.
 Those set of equation can be solved sequentially to compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{th}$
\end_inset

 order of the wavefunction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{m}}$
\end_inset

.
 Once 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{m}}$
\end_inset

is none the 
\begin_inset Formula $2m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2m+1$
\end_inset

 can be computed thanks to Wigner's rules using the follwing equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{2m}=\Braket{\Psi_{m-1}|V|\Psi_{m}}-\sum_{k=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m-1}E_{2m-k-j}\Braket{\Psi_{k}|\Psi_{j}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{2m+1}=\Braket{\Psi_{m}|V|\Psi_{m}}-\sum_{k=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m}E_{2m+1-k-j}\Braket{\Psi_{k}|\Psi_{j}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that with the definition of the zero order hamiltonian given in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:HFink"

\end_inset

, the first order energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}=\Braket{\Psi_{0}|V|\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 vanishes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a recent paper, both the 0 order wavefunctions and the succesives corrections
 were expressed as matrix product states (MPS) and computed deterministically
 by functional minimization, here we proposed an alternative approach were
 both the zero order and the pertubation wavefunction are sampled stochastically
 in the Hilbert space, the computation of the pertrubation energies are
 also evaluated stochastically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sample the zero order wavefunction and energy we used the standard FCIQMC
 approach restricted to the CAS space.
 We will recall here the main points of this approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Elements FCIQMC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FCIQMC is method which aims at stochastically minimizing the energy of a
 ground state wavefunctions expressed as a CAS-CI (or Full-CI) expansion.
 The wavefunction can be expressed as a linear combination of determinants
 belonging to the CAS-CI space.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Ket{\Psi}=\sum_{i}c_{i}\Ket{D_{i}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In FCIQMC the coefficient of this expansion are sampled by a population
 of walkers.
 Each of those carries a signed weight and is located on a Slater determinant.
 The total sum of the walkers residing on the same determinant can be interprete
d as an instantaneous measure of the its weight 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Formally, the idea is to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}$
\end_inset

, by integrating the imaginary time Schrodinger equation (ITSE),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi}}{\partial\tau}=-\hat{H}\Ket{\Psi}\label{eq:imtimeSE}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

.
 The discretization of Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:imtimeSE"

\end_inset

 with a time step 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 leads to the evolution equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Ket{\Psi(t+\Delta\tau)}=\left(\mathbb{I}-\Delta\tau\left(\hat{H}-S\mathbb{I}\right)\right)\Ket{\Psi(t)}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a shift parameter used to control the walkers population and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 is the identity operator.
 Thus starting from a guess wavefunction, for instance the Hartree Fock
 determinant, the ground state can be reached by repetitively applying the
 following projector .
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{P}=\mathbb{I}-\Delta\tau\left(\hat{H}-S\mathbb{I}\right),\label{eq:projector}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To circumvent the storage of the full CI vector that is impossible, in FCIQMC
 this projection operation is realized scholastically such as the proper
 projection is recovered on average.
 To mimic this projector the dynamic of the walker population is follows
 the following steps2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A cloning/death step, in which the walker population on each determinant
 is increase/reduced with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(H_{ii}-S\right)\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a shift parameter that is used to control the total walker population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A spawning step.
 For each walker on a determianant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

 a singly or doubly connected determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{j}}$
\end_inset

 is generated with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{gen}^{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 A signed child is actually generated on the determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{j}}$
\end_inset

with a spawning probability 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{spawn}=\frac{H_{ij}\Delta\tau}{p_{gen}^{ij}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each pairs of negative and positive newly spawned walkers lying on the same
 determinant are removed during an Anhiliation step.
 This avoid the growth of an infinite noise due to the so-call

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We propose here a modification of the FCIQMC algortihm in order to stochasticall
y sample simultaneously the zeroth order wavefunction and the succesive
 perturbation to it.
 Even if in principle any order of perturbation can be reached by this technique
, in this article we will only consider the calculation of the fist order
 correction to the wave function, that is given through Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bthorderwf"

\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Ket{\Psi_{1}}=\left(\hat{H}_{0}-E_{0}\right)^{-1}QV\Ket{\Psi_{0}}\label{eq:ps1equ}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case the problem is simpler since the Hilbert space on which the
 zeroth and first order wavefunctions are expanded is limited to the CASSD
 space.
 Moreover this space can be express as a direct sum of two subspaces 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}={\cal H}_{0}\oplus{\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{0}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the CAS space and 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is its orthogonal complimentary which in principle containded all the determina
nts that are single or double excitations from the ones belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Appying 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 only generates determinants on 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

.There is no need to actually ensure the orthogonality of the two wavefunctions,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 projector operator in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ps1equ"

\end_inset

 can be dropped.
 Of course higher order wavefunctions belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}$
\end_inset

 and would require to be orthogonlazed with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The zero order wavefnction follows an imaginariy time dependant Schrodinger
 equation similar to Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:imtimeSE"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi_{0}}}{\partial\tau}=-\hat{H}_{0}\Ket{\Psi_{0}}\label{eq:imtimeSEH0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

, it thus can be solved by using the standard FCIQMC algorithm, with the
 exception that new generated determinants will be restricted to one accessible
 by appling 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 on the current wave-function.
 This will effectively restrict the Hilbert space to the CAS space.
 The computation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 as defined in eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ps1equ"

\end_inset

 is less straighforward.
 Indeed in FCIQMC we do not have access to a proper description of the zeroth
 order wavefunction, this is thus not possible to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 by using the standard projection approach using Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ps1equ"

\end_inset

.
 The alternative is to also use stochastical sampling of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

, however in opposite to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 the perturbation wavefunctions do not follow a similar Schrodinger like
 equation.
 We introduced the following hierarchy of differential equation (DE).
 If the left hand side of this DE cancels, we recover the expression of
 Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ps1equ"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{m}}$
\end_inset

, in other word the successive correction wavefunction are stationnary solution
 of these DE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi_{m}}}{\partial\tau}=-\left(\hat{H}_{0}-E_{0}\right)\Ket{\Psi_{m}}-QV\left(\Ket{\Psi_{m-1}}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}E_{k}\Ket{\Psi_{m-k}}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In particular the DE for the first order perturbation is the following!
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi_{1}}}{\partial\tau}=-\left(\hat{H}_{0}-E_{0}\right)\Ket{\Psi_{1}}-QV\Ket{\Psi_{0}}.\label{eq:psi1diffeq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation is similar to the one used for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 or in the standard FCIQMC approach, with the addition of a source term
 due to second term of the right hand side.
 In the next section we will show how the simultaneous solving of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:imtimeSEH0"

\end_inset

 and Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 has been implemented in the NECI program.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simultameously stochastically sample the zeroth and first order wavefunctions
 we use the multi-replica technique as described in ....
 A first replica, labeled 0, is sampling the 0 order wavefunctions by propagatin
g the ITDSE in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:imtimeSEH0"

\end_inset

 while another one, labeled 1, is sampling the first order pertrubation.
 We first start with a small amount of walkers on a reference determinant,
 tipically the Hartree-Fock one, on replica 0 and no walkers on replica
 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In replica 0 new walkers are spawned by applying one and two electrons operators
 that belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{0}$
\end_inset

, thus only determinants that belong to the CAS space are generated.
 Because the sampling of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

is equivalent to a stanrdard FCIQMC sampling in a CASCI, we can use all
 the optimisations and approximations that have been introduced in previous
 publications such as initiator approximation, semi-stochastic approximation,
 etc...
 Tipically we use the initiator approximation, with an initiator criterium
 of 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the population on replica 0 is equilibrated we start to sample 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is done by applying doing multiple spawning attempt from walkers of
 replica 0.
 For each walkers of this we replica,in addition to the excitation that
 belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 we generate generate excitation that belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}$
\end_inset

.
 This thus generates determinants that belong to the external space, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 New walkers are spawned with a probability that has the expression that
 in Eq.
 However thoses walkers are spawned on replica 1 instead of replica 0.
 The fact that one replica is spawning on another is the main originality
 of this algorithm with respect to previous FCIQMC papers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replica 1 that was empty start to be filled by walkers coming from replica
 0, this correspond to the source term in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:psi1diffeq"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We emphasis on the fact that the replica 0 population dynamic is not modified
 by this extra excitation step, and that by construction the first and zeroth
 order wavefunctions are ortogonal to ecahother this prevents the use of
 ortogonalisation techniques that will be necessary for higher order perturbatio
n.
 The walkers on replica 1 are also submitted to a cloning/dying step and
 a spawning step at each iteration.
 For the dying step the applied operator is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(H_{0}-E_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}$
\end_inset

 can be set to CASCI value or estimated by the projected energy in replica
 0 if is unknown prior to running the calculation.
 For the Spawning step the excitations operator that are applied to the
 replica 1 walkers belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ensure that the newly generated determinants belong to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and that the two sampled wave-function remains orthogonal.
 The regime where the two wavefunctions are sampled simultaneously can be
 schematized as follow.

\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

 in the denominator.
 Because in interesting systems the size of the external space is much bigger
 than the one of the active space the probability of generating 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{j}}$
\end_inset

 pairs is much smaller in case of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 than in case of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 excitations.
 As a consequence the spawning probabilities of those excitations will be
 much bigger for the same timestep, or in other words, the time step should
 be smaller in the excitations involving the response functions.
 This problem is deal with as follow, the overall time step of the simulation
 is set by the 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 dynamic.
 The fist time there is too many spawning occurs during the 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 dynamic we keep track of the biggest blooming and compute the first integer
 bigger than this bloom, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{01}$
\end_inset

.
 during further step, the time step value will be divided by this 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 factor for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 spawning, this ensure to have spawning of always less than 1 walker.
 To keep the overall dynamic at the same time we have to do 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 spawning attempt to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket 1$
\end_inset

 for each walkers on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket 0$
\end_inset

.
 We use a similar procedure for the 
\begin_inset Formula $1\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 spawning defining 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{11}$
\end_inset

 timestep scaling factor.
 Those 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{01}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{00}$
\end_inset

 factors are updated along the run, this prevent any explosion of the replica
 1 population.

With this primarily implementation there is no way to control the total
 number of walkers on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 because there is no analogue to the shift control parameter of replica
 0.
 After a few steps the total number of walkers in replica 1 reaches a plateau
 that is dependent of the studied system.
 To control the value of that plateau the initiator approximation has been
 implementened for walkers that belong to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We allow the initiator treshold to be different in replica 0 and replica
 1.
 As a illsutration we studied the carbon dimer molecule with ccpvtz basis
 set, with 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{0}$
\end_inset

 coressponding to a CAS (8,8) which is the valence space of the molecule.
 We use a initaor treshold of 3 and a targeted number of walker of 50k for
 replica 0.
 In Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Looking at Fig.

\end_inset

 it can be seen than with no iniator approximation on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

, the number of walkers to sample the perturbation function is tremendous,
 more than 60 times the number of walkers in the reference.
 When using the most moderate initatior criterium of 1, this number is already
 reduced by more than a factor of 2, it can be further decrased by increasing
 the initiator treshold.
 However going from a treshold of 1 to 3 only reduced the total numer of
 walkers by roughly 30 %.
 However this is still not statisfying since there is now way to know what
 is going to be the number of walkers, and thus the cost of the calculation
 before running for this reason we describe hereafter a way to control the
 population on replica 1 indepedantely from the initiator treshold.

 We start by making the crude assumption that the number of walkers on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 also depends linearly of the perturbation and thus scale down the perturbation
 by a real prefactor 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, that is tipically small.
 This done in practice by multiplying the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by this factor when we compute the spawning probality from a determinant
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{0}$
\end_inset

 to a determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This allow to tune the total number of walkers on replica but again the
 dependancy between the this plateau and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 value is unknow.
 There are two reasons to this observation, the first one is that it was
 already not possible to predict the value of the plateau before using this
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 trick, the second is that the number of walkers is actually not scaling
 linearly with the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 because of the offdiagonal spawning in replica 1 and also beacause of the
 initiator approximation.
 To circumvent this problem we implemented a dynamic updating of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in order to reach a target number of walker on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

.
 The simulation is started with a small 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, typically 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

 ; after the a few thousand step of equilibration, if the number of walkers
 on replica 1 is not included with a 3% treshold of the target, we update
 alpha to a new value 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{new}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{\prime}=\alpha\left(\gamma+(1-\gamma)\frac{N_{t}}{N}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the target number of walkers, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the current number of walkers, and
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is a dumping parameter to prevent too drastic change of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 We use typically 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0.5$

 from determinants that spawned to

this iteration.
 This process does not cause any noticable increase of the computational

 As the contribution of a

\end_inset

 pair of determinants to the

 energy is only taken into account when a succsessfull spawning step is

 of such an event 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{spawn}^{ij}$

 To avoid double counting of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}C_{j}$
\end_inset

 contribution, it is also necessary to carefully check for the rare but
 still possible case of multiple spawning from the same determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$

 same determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{j}}$

 This is done passing the

An additional difficulty comes from the computation of the denominator of
 Eq.

 If we just take the sqaure of the number of walkers on a determinant in
 replica 0, a bias is introduced because 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle N_{i}\right\rangle \left\langle N_{i}\right\rangle \neq\left\langle N_{i}^{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, the square of the instantaneous value of the walker population is correlated.
 In the RDM computation this particular problem of the normalization was
 cirucmvenent by using the trace condition to normalize the RDM a posteriori.
 There is no such a relation to unbias the measure of the norm of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 here, instead we use a replica trick.
 This consist in adding a third replica, called 0' that is another indepandant
 sampling of the zero order wavefunction.
 The two simulations are uncorrelated and we can have an unbiased measure
 of the norm of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Braket{\Psi_{0}^{(0)}|\Psi_{0}^{(0^{\prime})}}=\sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}N_{i}^{(0)}N_{i}^{(0^{\prime})}$

The method described here have been tested on differents organic molecules.
 First we look at the behaviour of the method with respect to the size of
 the inactive space by computing the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 energy for the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset

 molecule with different basis set.
 In each case the active space consist of the valence orbitals of the molecule
 which correspond to a (8,8) CAS.
 In addition to the CAS, there are 2 core orbitals, we used the ccpvdz,
 ccpvtz and ccpvqz basis sets corresponding to three calculations with 16,
 50 and 100 virtuals orbitals respectively.
 We used 50k walkers and an initator treshold of 3 in replica 0, this treshold
 is set to 1 in replica 1.
 To investigate how the cost of the response scaled with the size of the
 inactive space, we increase the number of walkers in replica 1 until the
 computed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 agrees with the same quantity computed deterministically through MPS, with
 1mEH.
 The Required number of walkers are represented in fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 From this curve it can be seen that the required number of walkers on

 scales roughly as the square of the number of inactive orbitals.

 We start by using 100k walkers for each first order function, but to test
 the applicability of the methods, this number has been increased until
 the second order energy agrees with a precision of 1 
\begin_inset Formula $mE_{h}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

necessary to obtained this number are specified in Table.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:-energies-benz"

\end_inset

.
 We can see by looking at this table the classes of excitations are not
 equivalent in terms of the number of walkers necessary to converge.
 The class with two virtual orbitals require more walkers to reduce the
 initiator error.
 In particular the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-2,0,2\right)$
\end_inset

 class is particularly difficult, this is understandable since in this case
 this the class containing the biggest number of determinants, however it
 remains manageable to treat with the method proposed here.
 Considering the Singlet-Triplet gap, the CASSCF value is equals to 4.97
 eV while it is reduced to 4.86 eV when the LCC correction is used, the experimen
tal value determined by electron-impact spectroscopy is 4.76 eV.
 The agreement between ab-initio calculation and experiments is better than
 the one obtained by Roos et al that predicted a gap of 4.50 eV with CASSCF-PT2.

We then turned our attention to the computation of the triplet-singlet gap
 in the m-xylylene diradical.
 Organic diradicals can possibly be used for application in magnetic devices.
 The key parameter is the triplet-singet gap, thus some effort have been
 done in order to tune this parameter.
 Along the experiments it is itersting to predict the value of this singlet
 triplet gap to guide the synthesis of new promising molecules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the different organic diradicals, the m-xylylene has been used quite
 often as a benchmark system since it quite well know experminetally.
 The molecule belong to C2v point group, the ground state is 
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}B_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It has been shown by using NIPES that the lowest lying excited state is
 
\begin_inset Formula $^{1}A_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This system has been quite extensively studied numerically.
 For instance Maneru 
\shape italic
et al.
 
\shape default
carried an extensive study with DFT and differents wavefunctions methods
 exploring the effet of the geometries and of the basis set on the predicted
 gap.
 They found that the choice of the basis set have low inflence on the prdicted
 gap, however this gap is highly depedant of the choice of the functionnal.
 On the other hand the different wavefunctions methods the used all tends
 to oversestimate the singlet triplet gap.
 As the authors states 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the difficulty of the wave function-based methods in describing the triplet−sing
let gap arises quite unequivocally from dynamical correlation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We decided to evaluate the effect of the dynamical correlation by using
 the LCC-FCIQMC approach described here.
 We used the equilibrium geometries optimized at the CASSCF(8,8)/6-311++g**
 level given in supporting information of Maneru et al, for both the singlet
 and the triplet.
 We used the same basis set to run a CASSCF(8,8) calculation to generate
 the 2 and four indexes integrals files with Molpro.

In this article we described a way to do CASCI+MRLCC calculation that is
 completely stochastic.
 The zero order wavefunction is computed with the FCIQMC approach, i.e a
 population of walkers evolving thanks to a series of stochastic rules,
 is sampling the CASCI wavefuntion solving the zero order Hamiltonian eigen
 problem.
 Simulatenously, a second population of walkers submitted to a different
 set of stochastic process is sampling the first order wavefunction, by
 finding the steady state of a differential equation.
 The first order wavefunction being a function of of the zero order one,
 we include a source term in the population dynamic sampling 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 that depend of the population in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

, this requires spawning from one replica to the other, and this is the
 main originalty of the propose algorithm.
 We presented differents strategy to make the use of this technique practicable,
 some are directly adapted from the strategies proposed for FCIQMC, such
 as the initiator approximation and the semi-stochastic approach, we also
 use the scaling of the source term as a tunable way to controll the population.
 Because the size of the CASCI and of the perturbation are quite differetnt
 it was also necessary to have differents timesteps for the 0 to 0, 0 to
 1 and 1 to 1 processes.
 We illustrate the possibilty of the proposed methods on several applications.
 First we shows that this approach alows to recover the results computed
 by the deterministic MPS-LCC method on the case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 molecule.
 This calculation shows that the cost of the calculation, linked to the
 number of walkers, scale quadratically with the number of inactive orbitals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As already reported the LCC multireference pertrubaion theory seems to give
 better results than any other multireference theories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LCC-QMC approach proposed here allowes to treat both large active space
 and large inactive space; this associated with the recently demonstrated
 possibiliy of using FCIQMC-CASSCF allows to systems that are out of reach
 for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However computing dynamical correlation in systems containg a thousand of
 orbitals will still be unpractical, thus we are currently working on the
 developement of interal contraction within this approax to circumvent this
 limitation.
