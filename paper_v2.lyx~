 In that method both the zeroth order and first order wavefunctions are
 sampled stochastically by propagating simultaneously two populations of
 signed walkers.
 The sampling of the zeroth order wavefunction follows a set of stochastic
 processes identical to the one used in the FCIQMC method.
 The computation of the perturbation requires to introduce new rules for
 the stochastic process.
 In particular it involves a source term coming from the zeroth order wavefuncti
on.
 With this fully stochastic method, it will become possible to treat simultaneou
sly large active spaces to account for the static correlation and to recover
 the dynamical correlation using perturbation theory.
 The second order response energy is also computed stochastically, the different
 contribution being sampled according to the spawning probability between
 the zeroth and first order wavefunction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To illustrate the method, we study a few organic molecules, going from carbon
 dimer to aromatic molecules.
 We computed singlet-triplet gaps of benzene and m-xylylene.
 For m-xylylene which has proved difficult for standard CASSCF+PT we found
 a gap in good agreement with the experimental values.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the significant challenges in quantum chemistry is the description
 of electronic systems that simultaneously display chemically-relevant static
 and dynamical electron correlation.
 Static correlation often occurs in open shell systems and gives rise to
 long-ranged, highly entangled, many-electron wavefunctions involving electronic
 orbitals close to the Fermi energy.
 Dynamical correlation, on the other hand, correlates electrons on a short-lengt
h scale, and whose descriptions requires the single-particle spectrum to
 extend over many energy scales.
 There are many systems of practical interest that fall into this class:
 we can mention transition metal clusters that are found in many protein
 active sites and that play a key role in a wide number of important biological
 processes such as photosynthesis or respiration

.
 Because of the multideterminental nature of the wave-function they can
 prove hard to study with single-reference approaches such as the widely
 used density functional theory

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately the computational requirements to describe the wavefunction
 of such systems from an exact perspective is utterly daunting.
 In an ideal scenario, one would allow for a "full" correlation treatment
 in a large basis: in other words all electrons (even those not close to
 the Fermi energy) are simultaneously correlated over the entire basis.
 Such a treatment (full CI), which would amount to the exact solution of
 the Schrodinger equation in the given basis, is generally out of reach
 for sufficient numbers of electrons, owing the combinatorial explosion
 of the Hilbert space of a many-particle system.
 To overcome this limitation the calculation can be carried by considering
 only a meaningful subset of the available configurations, the most popular
 choice is to use a complete active space (CAS) wave function

 The core and virtual orbitals are respectively doubly occupied and empty
 in all configuration of the multi configuration expansion while the active
 orbitals can be empty, singly or doubly occupied.
 This approach allows to tackle bigger systems than the FCI one however
 it suffers for the same exponential scaling problem, the biggest active
 space that is possible to treat with this conventional implementation of
 this approach are typical 18 orbitals and 18 electrons.
 Different methods have been proposed to allow the use of larger active
 spaces such as the restricted active space (RAS)

 technique one can treat very large Hilbert spaces, corresponding of up
 30-40 electrons in 30-40 orbitals, but even such techniques struggle to
 handle systems with many hundreds of electrons correlating in hundreds
 or even thousands of orbitals, which is certainly necessary to able to
 treat as we move to even intermediate-size molecules.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Approximations in the correlation treatment are therefore necessary, and
 given the energetic divisions between static and dynamical correlation,
 multi-reference perturbation theory is a natural starting point, and which
 leads to a variety of "active-space" methods.
 Full treatment of correlation among a predefined set of active orbitals
 (usually chosen to be around the Fermi energy) with a given number of electrons
 leads to the reference Hamiltonian, followed by a pertubation treatment
 of the remaining terms in the Hamiltonian which arise from the remaining
 terms in the Hamiltonian.
 In this spirit, one can mention CASPT2

 In the perspective of dealing with large systems it is worth noticing that
 a second-order perturbation theory approach based on the generalized active
 space self-consistent-field has also recently been proposed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these multireference perturbation theories involve a deterministic
 resolution of the perturbation equations, and the cost of the calculation
 of the perturbation by itself quickly becomes intractable with the number
 of core and virtual orbitals.
 Although this can be dealt by making a further approximation known as internal
 contraction, which comes at the cost of computing the reduced density matrices
 (RDM) of the active space up to fourth order, which is itself a significant
 challenge for large active spaces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stochastic resolution of the perturbation equation seems to be a promising
 direction to reduce the cost of the calculation and to avoid the use of
 internal contraction.
 Surprisingly, only a few attempts to implement a stochastic resolution
 of perturbation theories have been proposed, among which we can mention
 the stochastic evaluation of MP2 energies by Hirata and collaborators,
 MC-MP2.
 This approach is based on the rewriting of second order perturbation equations
 into the sum of two 13-dimensional integrals thanks to Laplace transform.
 Those integrals are then evaluated through Monte-Carlo integration
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "willow_stochastic_2012,willow_convergence_2013,willow_stochastic_2013"

\end_inset

.
 Another approach to solve MP2 equations is to express its contributions
 in term of graph that describe set of connected Slater determinants, and
 then to stochastically sample those graphs
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "thom_stochastic_2007"

\end_inset

.
 However those two approaches involve a single reference zero order wavefunction
 and to our knowledge stochastic resolution of multireference perturbation
 theories have not been proposed yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this paper is to show how a stochastic treatment of multi-referen
ce perturbation theory can implemented within the FCIQMC methodology, namely
 a walker-based method to solve for the response wavefunction of perturbation
 theory.
 Response theory differs from the eigenvalue problem of diagonalisation
 in that involves the solution of a linear system of equations (the response
 equations).
 Since the FCIQMC technique was developed as a ground-state eigenvalue solver,
 it requires to be modified and generalized in order to handle this new
 setting.
 We show how this can be done for the MRLCC method, although it can be similarly
 implemented for other flavors of multi-reference perturbation theory.
 Importantly, the resulting method which we term LCCQMC, is a fully uncontracted
 method, and is therefore potentially more accurate than the internally
 contracted approximations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our new method the sampling of zeroth and first order wavefunctions are
 done simultaneously.
 The population on the zero order wavefunction follows the standard FCIQMC
 rules while the population dynamics of the response wavefunction contains
 a source term that depends on the population of the zero order wavefunction.
 This is practically done by allowing walkers on one replica to spawn new
 walkers on another replica.
 The structure of the rest of this article is the following, in the next
 part we will recall the governing equations of MRPT, with a particular
 emphasis on the LCC method.
 We also recall some basics of the FCIQMC methods before showing how the
 MRLCC can be expressed in the “FCIQMC language”, i.e.
 as a stochastic propagation of a signed walkers population.
 In the third part a description of the algorithmic of the QMC-LCC method
 that has been implemented in the neci code is given, we also discuss some
 important technical points.
 We then illustrate the potential of the method by applying it to some organic
 molecules.
 We first tested the method by studying the carbon dimer with systematically
 more refined basis set, going from cc-pVDZ to cc-pVQZ.
 Afterwards we turned our attention to the evaluation of Singlet-Triplet
 gaps; first in the case of the benzene molecule which has a singlet for
 ground state, and then in the case the m-xylylene diradical that admits
 a triplet as its ground state.

The successive correction (

 Those sets of equation can be solved sequentially to compute the

 the perturbation second-order energy is also evaluated stochastically.

\begin_layout Standard
FCIQMC is a method which aims at stochastically minimizing the energy of
 a ground state wavefunction expressed as a CASCI (or Full-CI) expansion.
 The wavefunction can be expressed as a linear combination of determinants
 belonging to the CAS-CI space.
\begin_inset Formula

Formally, the idea is to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian operator

, by integrating the imaginary time Schrodinger equation (ITSE),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi}}{\partial\tau}=-\hat{H}\Ket{\Psi}.\label{eq:imtimeSE}

The discretization of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 leads to the following evolution equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Ket{\Psi(t+\Delta\tau)}=\left(\mathbb{I}-\Delta\tau\left(\hat{H}-S\mathbb{I}\right)\right)\Ket{\Psi(t)}.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a shift parameter used to control the walkers population and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 is the identity operator.
 Thus starting from a guess wavefunction, for instance the Hartree Fock
 determinant, the ground state can be reached by repetitively applying the
 following projector .
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{P}=\mathbb{I}-\Delta\tau\left(\hat{H}-S\mathbb{I}\right),\label{eq:projector}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To circumvent the prohibitive storage of the full CI vector, in FCIQMC this
 projection operation is realized scholastically such as the proper projection
 is recovered on average.
 To do so the coefficient of the expansion in Eq.

 Each of those carries a signed weight and is located on a Slater determinant.
 The total signed sum of the walkers residing on the same determinant can

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case the problem is simpler since the Hilbert space on which the
 zeroth and first order wavefunctions are expanded is limited to the CASSD
 space.
 Moreover this space can be expressed as a direct sum of two subspaces 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}={\cal H}_{0}\oplus{\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{0}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the CAS space and 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is its orthogonal compliment which contains all the determinants that are
 single or double excitations from the ones belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 only generates determinants on 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

 There is thus no need to ensure the orthogonality of the two wavefunctions
 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 projector operator in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Of course higher order wavefunctions would contain determinants that are
 higher order excitations from the CASCI space.

The zero order wavefunction follows an ITDSE similar to Eq.

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi_{0}}}{\partial\tau}=-\hat{H}_{0}\Ket{\Psi_{0}},\label{eq:imtimeSEH0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

it thus can be solved by using the standard FCIQMC algorithm, with the exception
 that new generated determinants will be restricted to the one accessible
 by applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 on the current wave-function.
 This will effectively restrict the Hilbert space to the CAS space, and
 correspond to freezing the core and virtual orbitals.
 The computation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 as defined in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ps1equ"

\end_inset

 is less straighforward.
 Indeed in FCIQMC we do not have access to a proper description of the zeroth
 order wavefunction.
 It is thus not possible to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 by using a projection approach.
 As an alternative we also decide to sample 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 stochastically.
 However as opposed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 the perturbation wavefunctions are not solution of an ITDSE.
 We introduced the following hierarchy of differential equation (DE).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi_{m}}}{\partial\tau}=-\left(\hat{H}_{0}-E_{0}\right)\Ket{\Psi_{m}}-QV\left(\Ket{\Psi_{m-1}}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}E_{k}\Ket{\Psi_{m-k}}\right).\label{eq:pismDestoch}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If the left hand side of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pismDestoch"

\end_inset

 cancels out, we recover the expression of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bthorderwf"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{m}}$
\end_inset

, in other words the successive correction wavefunctions are stationary
 solution of these DE.
 Note that propagating this equation is actually going to reach a steady
 state, that is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{m}}$
\end_inset

 because the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\hat{H}_{0}-E_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 matrix is positive definite.
 In particular the DE for the first order perturbation is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\Ket{\Psi_{1}}}{\partial\tau}=-\left(\hat{H}_{0}-E_{0}\right)\Ket{\Psi_{1}}-V\Ket{\Psi_{0}}.\label{eq:psi1diffeq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation is similar to the one used for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$

To simultaneously sample the zeroth and first order wavefunctions, we use
 the multi-replica technique
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 A first replica, labeled 0, is sampling the 0 order wavefunctions by propagatin
g the ITDSE of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:imtimeSEH0"

\end_inset

 while another one, labeled 1, is sampling the first order perturbation.
 We first start with a small amount of walkers on a reference determinant,
 typically the Hartree-Fock one, on replica 0 and no walkers on replica
 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In replica 0 new walkers are spawned by applying one and two electrons operators
 that belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{0}$
\end_inset

, thus only determinants that belong to the CAS space are generated.
 Because the sampling of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to a standard FCIQMC sampling in a CASCI, we can use all
 the optimizations and approximations that have been introduced in previous
 publications such as initiator approximation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cleland_communications:_2010,cleland_taming_2012"

\end_inset

 or the semi-stochastic approximation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the population on replica 0 is equilibrated we start to sample 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

.
 This equilibration of the zeroth order wavefunction can be monitored by
 looking at the variational energy for this replica and checking that is
 correspond to the CASCI energy.
 At this point we attempt multiple spawning from each walkers of replica
 0.
 In addition to the excitation that belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{0}$
\end_inset

 we also generate excitation belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}$
\end_inset

.
 This thus generates determinants that belong to the external space, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The spawning probability of those 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 walkers follows the expression of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pspawn"

\end_inset

.
 However those walkers are spawned on replica 1 instead of replica 0.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replica 1 that was initially empty starts get populated, the walkers coming
 from replica 0 correspond to the source term in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We emphasize the fact that in replica 0 the population dynamic is not modified
 by this extra excitation step, and that by construction the first and zeroth
 order wavefunctions are orthogonal to each other, this obviates the use
 of orthogonalization techniques that will be required for the higher order
 perturbation.
 The walkers on replica 1 are also subjected to a cloning/dying step and
 a spawning step at each iteration.
 For the dying step the applied operator is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\hat{H}_{0}-E_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

, where the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the projected energy in replica 0.
 For the spawning step, the applied excitation operator belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{0}$
\end_inset

.

Note that with this implementation the timesteps used for

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 spawning steps, and the 0 and 1 cloning and dying steps are identical.
 It is the one that has been optimized for replica 0.
 In practice this timestep is chosen to ensure that the spawning probability
 in replica 0 is small enough to ensure that the spawning probability is
 not much bigger than 1 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 As can be seen of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 the spawning probability is inversely proportional to the generation probabilit
y 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{gen}$
\end_inset

 to attempt a spawning on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{j}}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 Because in interesting systems the size of the external space is expected
 to be much bigger than the one of the active space the probability of generatin
g 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{j}}$
\end_inset

 pairs is much smaller in case of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 than in case of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 excitation.
 As a consequence the spawning probabilities of those excitation will be
 much bigger than 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 spawning probability for the same timestep, and a single walker would give
 birth to multiple walkers; such an event is called blooming.
 In other words, the time step should be smaller in the excitations involving
 the response functions.
 This problem is dealt with as follow, the overall time step of the simulation
 is set by the 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 dynamic.
 The first time blooming occurs during the 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 spawning step we keep track of the biggest bloom and compute the first
 integer bigger than this, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{01}$
\end_inset

.
 During further step, the time step value will be divided by this 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{01}$
\end_inset

 factor for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 spawning, this ensures to have a spawning probability not much bigger than
 1.
 To keep the overall dynamic at the same timestep we have to do 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{01}$
\end_inset

 spawning attempt to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket 1$
\end_inset

 for each walkers on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket 0$
\end_inset

.
 We use a similar procedure for the 
\begin_inset Formula $1\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 spawning defining a 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{11}$
\end_inset

 timestep scaling factor.
 Those 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{01}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{11}$
\end_inset

 factors are updated along the run, this prevent any explosion of the replica
 1 population.

\begin_layout Standard
With this implementation there is no way to control the total number of
 walkers on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 because there is no analogue of the shift control parameter that is used
 for replica 0.
 After a few steps the total number of walkers in replica 1 reaches a plateau
 that is dependent of the system.
 As a first attempt to control the value of that plateau the initiator approxima
tion has been implemented for walkers that belong to replica 1.
 We allow the initiator threshold to be different in replica 0 and replica
 1.
 As an illustration we studied the carbon dimer molecule with the cc-pVQZ
 basis set

, with 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal H}_{0}$

 corresponding to a CAS (8,8) which is the valence space of the molecule.
 We use a initiator threshold of 3 and a targeted number of walker of 50k
 for replica 0.
 In Fig.

 it can be seen that with no initiator approximation on

, the number of walkers grows to more than 60 times the number of walkers
 in the reference.
 When using the most moderate initiator criteria of 1, this number is already
 reduced by more than a factor of 2, it can be further decreased by increasing
 the initiator threshold.
 However going from a threshold of 1 to 3 only reduced the total number
 of walkers by roughly 30 %.
 This is still not satisfying since there is no way to know

We start by making the assumption that the number of walkers on

\end_inset

 also depends linearly on the perturbation
\color inherit
 and thus scale down the perturbation by a real prefactor 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, that is typically small.
 This is done in practice by multiplying the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by this factor when the spawning probability from a determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$

 to a determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{D_{i}}$

 is computed.
 This allows us to tune more easily the total number of walkers on replica,
 also the relation between the value of the plateau and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 remains unknown.
 The number of walkers does not strictly scales linearly with the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 
\color blue
because of the offdiagonal spawning in replica 1

 To circumvent this problem we implemented a dynamic updating of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 in order to reach a target number of walker on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$

 The simulation is started with a small 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$

 on replica 1 is not included within a 3% treshold of the target, we update
 alpha to a new value 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{\prime}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{\prime}=\alpha\left(\gamma+(1-\gamma)\frac{N_{t}}{N}\right)

 is the current number of walkers, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 is a dumping parameter to prevent too drastic a change of

Having implemented this way of controlling the population in replica 1 we
 now will study the influence of the number of walkers used to sample the
 response function on the second order energy.
 The second order correction energy is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{2}=\frac{\Braket{\Psi_{0}|\hat{V}|\Psi_{1}}}{\Braket{\Psi_{0}|\Psi_{0}}}=\frac{\sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}\sum_{j\in{\cal H}_{1}}c_{i}c_{j}\Braket{D_{i}|\hat{V}|D_{j}}}{\sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}ci^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the FCIQMC framework this can be rewritten as a function of the walker
 population on each determinants involved.
 In the LCC pertrubation theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\Braket{D_{i}|\hat{V}|D_{j}}=\Braket{D_{i}|\hat{H}|D_{j}}=H_{ij}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{2}\approx\left\langle \tilde{E}_{2}\right\rangle =\frac{\Braket{\Psi_{0}|\hat{V}|\Psi_{1}}}{\Braket{\Psi_{0}|\Psi_{0}}}=\frac{\left\langle \sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}\sum_{j\in{\cal H}_{1}}N_{i}N_{j}H_{ij}\right\rangle }{\left\langle \sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}N_{i}^{2}\right\rangle }=\frac{\left\langle \sum_{j\in{\cal H}_{1}}N_{j}\left[\sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}N_{i}H_{ij}\right]\right\rangle }{\left\langle \sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}N_{i}^{2}\right\rangle },\label{eq:E2}

 This strategy does not cause any noticeable increase of the computational

 As the contribution of a

 To avoid double counting of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}C_{j}$

 possible case of multiple spawning from the same determinant

An additional difficulty comes from the computation of the denominator of
 Eq.

 If we just take the square of the number of walkers on a determinant in

 In the RDM computation this particular problem of the normalization was

 There is no such relation to unbias the measure of the norm of

 here, instead we use a replica trick.
 This requires the additon a third replica, labeled

 that is also sampling the zero order wavefunction.
 Because the two replica 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

\begin_inset Formula $0^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 are uncorrelated we can have an unbiased measure of the norm of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Braket{\Psi_{0}^{(0)}|\Psi_{0}^{(0^{\prime})}}=\sum_{i\in{\cal H}_{0}}N_{i}^{(0)}N_{i}^{(0^{\prime})}$

 Finally, it is necessary to rescale the

 The blue curve is obtained by setting the initiator threshold to 1 and
 controlling the number of walkers on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 by using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 controlling parameter.
 For comparison purpose, the value obtained using DMRG is in red.

In Fig.

\end_inset

, the blue curve is obtained with an initiator threshold of 1 and different
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 to constrained the number of walkers.
 The most interesting feature is that, for the same number of walkers on
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 it seems to be better to actually set a smaller initiator threshold and
 to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 trick than increasing the initiator threshold.
 For instance for roughly 1M walkers the value obtained with initiator threshold
 of 1 and an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.73$
\end_inset

 is 0.16 
\begin_inset Formula $mE_{H}$
\end_inset

 lower than the one obtained by using an initiator of 3.

In order to improve further the efficiency of our implementation, we notice
 that the

 space can be split as the orthogonal sum of 8 smaller subspaces corresponding
 to the 8 subclasses of excitation defined by Malrieu and collaborators

 To each of this subspace correspond a subclass of excitation that we can
 denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{(a,b,c)}$

, connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{0}$
\end_inset

 is applied to a determinant belonging to one of those subspaces, the generated
 determinants also belong to this subspace.
 This means that during the dynamic, there are no interactions between walkers
 belonging to 2 different subclasses.
 Instead of running a single calculation by applying the full 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 it is possible to run 8 independent simpler calculations using each of
 8 different classes of excitations 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{(a,b,c)}$
\end_inset

 and finally sum up the 8 different second order energies obtained.

The LCC-QMC method proposed here has been applied to several organic molecules.
 First we look at the behavior of the method with respect to the size of
 the inactive space by computing the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 energy for the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset

 molecule with different basis set.
 In each case the active space consist of the valence orbitals of the molecule
 which correspond to a (8,8) CAS.
 In addition to the CAS, there are 2 core orbitals and 16, 50 and 100 virtual
 orbitals respectively in the cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets used
 here.
 The CASSCF orbitals have been generated using the Molpro quantum chemistry
 package

We used 50k walkers and an initiator threshold of 3 in replica 0, this threshold
 is set to 1 in replica 1.
 The response wavefunction is sampled by applying the full 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}$
\end_inset

 operator to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 wavefunction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate how the cost of the response scale with the size of the inactive
 space, we increase the number of walkers in replica 1 until the computed
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 agrees within 
\begin_inset Formula $1\ mE_{H}$
\end_inset

 with the same quantity computed deterministically with MPS-LCC using the
 Block code

 The Required number of walkers are represented in Fig.

 From this curve it can be seen that the number of walkers on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 necessary to reach a 
\begin_inset Formula $mE_{H}$
\end_inset

 precision scales roughly as the square of the number of inactive orbitals.

 C-C and C-H bond lengths of 1.395

 The ground state of the benzene molecule is singlet 
\begin_inset Formula $^{1}A_{1g}$

\begin_inset Formula $^{3}E_{1u}$

 We used the Dunning cc-pVDZ basis set, the active space contains 6 electrons
 and the six valence 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

 We used CASSCF orbitals generated using Molpro.

\begin_layout Standard
For the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$

 CASCI wavefunction we used an initiator threshold of 3 and 100k walkers.
 In order to make the calculation more tractable, we run 8 subcalculations
 corresponding to each of the orthogonal classes of excitation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{V}_{(a,b,c)}$
\end_inset

.
 The initiator threshold on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 is set to 1.5.
 We start by using 100k walkers for each first order function, but to test
 the applicability of the methods, this number has been increased until
 the second order energy agrees with a precision of 1 
\begin_inset Formula $mE_{h}$
\end_inset

 with the one predicted deterministicaly by LCC-MPS.
 The values obtained for the second order energies for the different classes
 and the number of walkers it was necessary to use on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 to obtain these values are specified in Table.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1,1,0\right)$
\end_inset

 class is not contributing since it has no overlap with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 wavefunction for spatial orbital symmetry reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see by looking at this table that the classes of excitations are
 not equivalent in terms of the number of walkers necessary to converge.
 The classes involving virtual orbitals require more walkers to reduce the
 initiator error.
 In particular the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-2,0,2\right)$
\end_inset

 class is particularly difficult, this is understandable since in this case
 this the class containing the biggest number of determinants

 Considering the Singlet-Triplet gap, the CASSCF value is equals to 4.97
 eV while it is reduced to 4.88 eV when the LCC correction is used, the experimen
tal value determined by electron-impact spectroscopy is 4.76 eV

 We also computed the singlet-triplet gap with CASPT2 where internal contraction
 is used only for the subspaces requiring at most the knowledge of the second
 order reduced density matrix while the other subspaces are left uncontracted
 and NEVPT2 strongly contracted using Molpro, we obtained an difference
 of 4.65 eV and 5.03 eV respectively.

We then turned our attention to the computation of the triplet-singlet gap
 in the m-xylylene diradical.
 The study of radical organic species and the prediction of their spin propertie
s is of interest because of potential application in the developement of
 molecule-based magnetic materials

The key parameter for such application is the triplet-singet gap, thus some
 effort have been done in order to tune this parameter.
 Along the experiments it is interesting to predict the value of this singlet
 triplet gap to guide the synthesis of new promising molecules.

Among the different organic diradicals, the m-xylylene has been used quite

carried an extensive study with DFT and several wavefunction methods exploring
 the effect of the geometries and of the basis set on the predicted gap.
 They found that the choice of the basis set have low influence on the predicted
 gap, however as expected the value of the gap is highly dependent of the
 choice of the functional.
 On the other hand, all the different wavefunctions methods they used tends
 to overestimate the singlet triplet gap.
 Even with more sophisticated basis set their predicted value of the singlet-tri
plet gap remains quite close to the value of 4092

As the authors states 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the difficulty of the wave function-based methods in describing the triplet−sing
let gap arises quite unequivocally from dynamical correlation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They proposed to extend the CAS space as a way to recover the dynamical
 correlation is improperly taken account, however as they correctly stated
 this will make the calculation computationally challenging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an alternative we decided to examine how a better treatment of dynamical
 correlation by using the LCC multireference perturbation theory with the
 same CAS space would improve the prediction of the singlet-triplet gap.
 We used the equilibrium geometries optimized at the CASSCF(8,8)/6-311++g**
 level given in supporting information of Mañeru et al, for both the singlet
 and the triplet.
 We used the same basis set to run a CASSCF(8,8) calculation to generate
 the 2 and 4 indexes integrals files with the Molpro quantum package.
 We computed the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 energies for the 8 classes with MPS-LCC using internal contraction as a
 reference.
 We start by using a procedure similar to the one used with the benzene
 molecule which is setting the iniator criteria to 1.5 in for the first order
 response functions and progressively increasing the number of walker sample
 it.
 However except for the two classes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-2,2,0\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,-1,1\right)$
\end_inset

 this procedure has failed, since the obtained value where much higher than
 the one predicted by MPS-LCC.
 We thus decided to run calculation with a initiator criterium of 1 and
 no control of the population i.e an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 factor of 1.
 The number obtained and the number of walkers reached on replica 1 are
 given in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:-energies-xyl"

\end_inset

.
 With this procedure the obtained number are in agreement with the MPS-LCC
 results, there are usually a bit more negative since this is a fully uncontract
ed technique.
 However this approach is not really practical since the number of walkers
 reached on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{\Psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

 is generally huge, making the calculation extremely costly.
 Moreover in the case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-2,0,2\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1,-1,2\right)$
\end_inset

 classes it was not possible to do the calculation.

 This shows that using the MRLCC perturbation theory improves a lot the

\begin_layout Standard
Thus as Mañeru

 stated, the problem in the description of the m-xylylene was a proper treatment
 of the dynamical correlation.
 However this problem is still out of reach for the fully uncontracted LCC-QMC,
 this indicated clearly that to make LCC-QMC practical it would be necessary
 to implement some internal contraction treatment of the perturbation classes.
 However he fact that the most easy classes in the LCC-QMC approach is the
 one that would require the 3 and 4-RDM to be computed with internal contraction
 is encouraging.

 a population of signed walkers which is evolving thanks to a series of

 Simultaneously, a second population of walkers submitted to a different

 finding the steady state of a differential equation.
 The first order wavefunction being a function of the zero order one, we

, this requires spawning from one replica to the other, and this is the
 main originality of the proposed algorithm.
 We presented different strategy to make the use of this technique practicable,
 some are directly adapted from the strategies proposed for FCIQMC, such
 as the initiator approximation and the semi-stochastic approach.
 We also proposed to scale the source term as a way to control the population
 in the replica sampling the first order wavefunction.
 Because the size of the CASCI and of the perturbation are quite different
 it was also necessary to have different timesteps for the 0 to 0, 0 to
 1 and 1 to 1 spawning steps.
 We illustrate the possibility of the proposed methods on several applications.
 First we shows that this approach allows to recover the results computed
 by the deterministic MPS-LCC method on the case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$

 molecule.
 This calculation shows that the cost of the calculation, linked to the
 number of walkers, scale quadratically with the number of inactive orbitals.

The computation of the singlet-triplet gap of the challenging m-xylylene
 diradical with the proposed method confirmed the better performance of
 the MRLCC perturbation theory with respect to the CASPT2 technique.
 It has been possible to obtain a value of this gap that is in good agreement
 with the experimental results while the CASPT2 approach using the same
 active space overestimate this quantity by 20%.
 However it has also been demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is still
 not adapted to study such complicated systems since the class of excitation
 involving two cores electrons and to virtuals holes cannot be computed
 for the m-xylylene molecule.
 This problem has been circumvent by computing those classes by using the
 contracted MPS-LCC technique.
 This point out the necessity to develop a similar contracted approach with
 our fully stochastic procedure, this is currently under investigation.

The LCC-QMC approach proposed here would allow to treat both large active
 space and large inactive space; this associated with the recently demonstrated
 possibility of using FCIQMC-CASSCF
